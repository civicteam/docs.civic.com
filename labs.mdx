# Civic Labs ðŸ§ª

Civic Labs is where Civic explores bold ideas in digital identity, agentic AI, and authorization. It's not a product showcaseâ€”it's a living bench of experiments, some just getting started, some ready to test, all open to feedback and community input.

Each project is presented as a **flask**: bubbling, distilling, or crystallizing.

- **Bubbling** â€“ just an idea, nothing public yet
- **Distilling** â€“ in active development, early versions exist
- **Crystallizing** â€“ functionally complete, available for testing

Explore the flasks below or get in touch if you want to contribute, try things early, or shape what comes next.

## ðŸ”¬ Projects

Our current experiments focus on Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and AI security. These tools help developers build safer, more controlled AI applications with proper identity and authorization.
