Civic Labs is where Civic explores ideas in digital identity, agentic AI, and authorization.
Here you'll find a suite of experiments and tools, some just getting started, some ready to test, all open to feedback and community input.

Each project is presented as a **flask**, representing different stages of experimental development. [Learn more about flask status â†’](/labs/flask-status)

Explore the flasks below or [get in touch](/labs/feedback) if you want to contribute, try things early, or shape what comes next.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Want to try out these experiments? [Get started here](/labs/getting-started).

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback & Contribution

We're building in the open and love community input. [Learn how to contribute](/labs/feedback).

## ðŸ”¬ Projects

Our current experiments focus on Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and AI security. These tools help developers build safer, more controlled AI applications with proper identity and authorization.
