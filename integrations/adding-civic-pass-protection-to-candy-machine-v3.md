# Adding Civic Pass protection to Candy Machine v3

## Adding Civic Pass to Candy Machine v3

Want to keep bots out your next NFT drop?&#x20;

We are fully integrated into MetaPlex's Candy Machine v3 protocol to enable mint protection using [Candy Guard](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/gatekeeper).

We recommend using the [latest sugar command line tool](https://docs.metaplex.com/developer-tools/sugar/guides/sugar-for-cmv3) to create your mint.

#### Creating a protected mint using Sugar CLI

In Candy Machine v3 creation of the token guard is separate from the mint.

1. install sugar: currently sugar support for Candy Machine is alpha mode and needs to be downloaded [here](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar/releases/tag/sugar-cmv3-alpha.2)
2.  Create your mint (with Candy Machine v3 the mint and the token guard are created separately) using. Follow the prompts on the CLI:

    ```
    sugar launch
    ```
3.  A config.json should have been created. Edit this file and add a 'guards' section (see the section below for alternative networks):\


    ```
    "guards": {
        "default": {
          "gatekeeper": {
            "gatekeeperNetwork": "ignREusXmGrscGNUesoU9mxfds9AiYTezUKex2PsZV6",
            "expireOnUse": false
          }
        },
        "groups": null
      }
    ```
4.  Create the guard for your mint:

    ```
    sugar guard add
    ```
5.  The script should run successfully and you should see output like below:

    ```
    %  sugar guard add
    [1/3] üîç Looking up candy machine

    The candy guard is now the mint authority of the candy machine.

    ‚úÖ Command successful.
     
    ```

#### Captcha-protection

Use this guards config for captcha protection:

```
"gatekeeper": {
    "gatekeeperNetwork": "ignREusXmGrscGNUesoU9mxfds9AiYTezUKex2PsZV6",
    "expireOnUse": true
  },
```

When captcha is enabled, a user will be issued a Civic Captcha Pass after successfully completing the captcha challenge and automatically checked by the Candy Machine prior to minting.

A Civic Captcha Pass **remains active only for 10 minutes and for one mint** to limit the options of malicious botters verifying multiple wallets. If a user tries to use an inactive pass, it will automatically prompt them to refresh it.

#### Liveness protection

Use this guards config for liveness protection:

```
"gatekeeper": {
    "gatekeeperNetwork": "vaa1QRNEBb1G2XjPohqGWnPsvxWnwwXF67pdjrhDSwM",
    "expireOnUse": true
  },
```

When liveness is enabled, a user must do a 3D video selfie to prove they are not a bot before they can mint.&#x20;
