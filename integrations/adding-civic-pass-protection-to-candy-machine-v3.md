# Adding Civic Pass protection to Candy Machine v3

We are fully integrated into MetaPlex's Candy Machine v3 protocol to enable mint protection using [<mark style="color:orange;">Candy Guard</mark>](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/gatekeeper).

Permissioning with Civic Pass & Candy Guard allows you to verify minters in real-time, evaluating every request to mint by your criteria, including:

* conducting a bot check using CAPTCHA
* checking for liveness and uniqueness
* checking for a minimum age
* checking buyers from locations you want to allow
* checking ID documents and KYC/Sanctions

You can use our [<mark style="color:orange;">reference implementation UI template using Candy Machine V3 with integrated Civic Pass -></mark>](https://github.com/civicteam/Candy-Machine-V3-UI)<mark style="color:orange;"></mark>

We recommend using the [<mark style="color:orange;">latest sugar command line tool</mark>](https://docs.metaplex.com/developer-tools/sugar/guides/sugar-for-cmv3) to create your mint.

#### Creating a protected mint using Sugar CLI

In Candy Machine v3 creation of the token guard is separate from the mint.

1. install sugar: currently sugar support for Candy Machine is alpha mode and needs to be downloaded [<mark style="color:orange;">here</mark>](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar/releases/tag/sugar-cmv3-alpha.2)<mark style="color:orange;"></mark>
2.  Create your mint (with Candy Machine v3 the mint and the token guard are created separately) using. Follow the prompts on the CLI:

    ```
    sugar launch
    ```
3.  A config.json should have been created. Edit this file and add a 'guards' section (see the section below for alternative networks):\


    ```
    "guards": {
        "default": {
          "gatekeeper": {
            "gatekeeperNetwork": "ignREusXmGrscGNUesoU9mxfds9AiYTezUKex2PsZV6",
            "expireOnUse": false
          }
        },
        "groups": null
      }
    ```
4.  Create the guard for your mint:

    ```
    sugar guard add
    ```
5.  The script should run successfully and you should see output like below:

    ```
    %  sugar guard add

    The candy guard is now the mint authority of the candy machine.

    ‚úÖ Command successful.
     
    ```

### Enabling Civic Pass Checks

#### CAPTCHA Check

When CAPTCHA is enabled, a user will be issued a Civic Pass after successfully completing a CAPTCHA challenge and automatically checked by the Candy Machine prior to minting.

Use this guard's config for captcha protection:

```
"gatekeeper": {
    "gatekeeperNetwork": "ignREusXmGrscGNUesoU9mxfds9AiYTezUKex2PsZV6",
    "expireOnUse": true
  },
```

A Civic Captcha Pass **remains active only for 10 minutes and for one mint** to limit the options of malicious botters verifying multiple wallets. If a user tries to use an inactive pass, it will automatically prompt them to refresh it.

#### Liveness Check

When liveness is enabled, a user must do a 3D video selfie to prove they are a real person and not a bot before they can mint.

Use this guard's config for liveness protection:

```
"gatekeeper": {
    "gatekeeperNetwork": "vaa1QRNEBb1G2XjPohqGWnPsvxWnwwXF67pdjrhDSwM",
    "expireOnUse": true
  },
```

****

**Uniqueness Check**

When uniqueness is enabled, the user must do a 3D video selfie to ensure that a real person only uses one wallet to mint. You can decide how many NFTs this unique user can mint.

<mark style="color:orange;"></mark>[<mark style="color:orange;">Contact us</mark>](../civic-pass/selecting-a-pass.md) to get the gatekeeper information to setup your guard's config.



**Age Check**

When age check is enabled, the user must provide a government issued ID and complete a 3D video selfie before they they are issued a Civic Pass.&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;"></mark>[<mark style="color:orange;">Contact us</mark>](../civic-pass/selecting-a-pass.md) to get the gatekeeper information to setup your guard's config.

****

**Location Check**

When IP-based location check (including VPN detection) is enabled, the user must be in a country that you allow to participate in your mint prior to being issued a Civic Pass.

****

**ID Document & KYC/Sanction Check**

When enabled, the user must provide a government issued ID and complete a 3D video selfie before they they are issued a Civic Pass. Sanction checks can also be performed prior to issuing a Civic Pass.
