## Civic Pass

Civic Pass enables dApps to allow vetted users to participate in their offerings. Verify liveness, perform identity verification, and more.

Integrate Civic Pass into your platform and create an identity layer that allows for a permissioned dApp platform, be it an NFT mint or marketplace, a metaverse, or any other project you might come up with.
