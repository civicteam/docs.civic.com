# Civic Nexus Integration Prompt (TypeScript)

## Task
Integrate Civic Nexus with an AI SDK in this TypeScript/JavaScript application.

## Step 1: Gather Information
Ask the user:
1. **Which AI SDK are you using?**
   - Vercel AI SDK
   - OpenAI Agents SDK
   - Anthropic Messages API
2. **What is your Civic Auth Client ID?** (Get it from https://auth.civic.com)
3. **What framework are you using?** (Next.js, Node.js, etc.)

## Step 2: Find the Recipe
Navigate to https://docs.civic.com, search for "Nexus", then navigate to Recipes:
- If user chose **Vercel AI SDK** → Find and read "Vercel AI SDK" recipe
- If user chose **OpenAI Agents SDK** → Find and read "OpenAI Agents SDK" recipe
- If user chose **Anthropic Messages API** → Find and read "Anthropic Messages API" recipe

Read the complete recipe and follow all the steps exactly as written.

## Step 3: Set Up Environment
Tell the user to create `.env.local` with:
```bash
CIVIC_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=their_client_id_from_step1
# Tell them to add their AI provider key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx
```

## Step 4: Follow the Recipe
Implement exactly what the recipe shows:
- Install the packages listed
- Set up Civic Auth as shown
- Implement the integration code
- For Next.js: Put middleware.ts in src/ directory

## Step 5: Test
Guide them to:
1. Run dev server
2. Test with "list my GitHub repos"

## Important
- Get their Client ID upfront
- Never ask for API keys - tell them to add to .env.local
- Follow the recipe exactly
- The recipe has all the details
```
