**Important: The SDK Handles Everything**

The Civic Auth Python SDK abstracts away all token validation complexity. You do **NOT** need to:
- Implement custom middleware for token validation
- Parse or validate JWT tokens manually  
- Handle token refresh logic yourself

Simply use the provided decorators and user access functions - the SDK handles all authentication logic for you.
