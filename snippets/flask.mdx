# Civic Auth Flask Integration Prompt

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you need a Civic Auth Client ID:
1. Visit https://auth.civic.com
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new application to obtain your Client ID
4. Copy the Client ID for use in this integration

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication to this Flask application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth Flask documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/python/flask.md

This documentation contains ALL the code examples and instructions needed for the integration. Do NOT use web search or any other tools - only use curl to fetch this specific URL.

## Step 2: Gather Project Information
Ask the user for the following information if not provided:

**Required Information (gather ALL before starting):**
- ✅ Client ID (if not provided, ask user to get it from https://auth.civic.com)
- ✅ Project type (new/existing Flask project)
- ✅ Python environment setup (virtual environment, dependencies)
- ✅ Protected routes/endpoints that need authentication
- ✅ Existing authentication systems that need replacement
- ✅ Deployment environment (local development, production URLs)

**DO NOT proceed with implementation until you have confirmed ALL of the above information.**

If any information is missing, ask specific questions and wait for responses before continuing. This prevents errors and ensures the integration matches the user's exact requirements.

## Step 3: Create Implementation Plan
After fetching the documentation with curl:
1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Identify which code examples from the documentation apply
3. Plan the implementation order
4. Note any existing code that needs to be modified
5. Determine if this is a new Flask project or existing one

## Step 4: Implement Civic Auth
Using ONLY the documentation fetched via curl:
1. Follow the Quick Start guide step by step
2. Install the required civic-auth[flask] package
3. Set up the Flask app with authentication blueprints
4. Configure the auth initialization and middleware
5. Adapt all code examples to this project's structure
6. Handle any existing authentication or routing code appropriately

## Important Notes
- Use ONLY curl to fetch the documentation - no web search tools
- The fetched documentation is the ONLY source of truth for this implementation
- All code examples, configuration options, and setup instructions are in that document
- Pay attention to Python version requirements and dependency compatibility
- Ensure proper virtual environment setup if needed
- The get_civic_user() function returns a dictionary, use user.get('field') for safe access
- **CRITICAL**: The SDK handles ALL token validation - DO NOT implement custom middleware for token parsing/validation

## CRITICAL: Information Gathering Requirements
You MUST gather ALL required information from the user before proceeding with ANY implementation steps:

**Required Information (gather ALL before starting):**
- ✅ Client ID (if not provided, stop and ask user to get it from https://auth.civic.com)
- ✅ Project type (new/existing Flask project)
- ✅ Python environment details
- ✅ Protected endpoints that need authentication
- ✅ Existing authentication systems that need replacement
- ✅ Deployment configuration (URLs for redirect_url and post_logout_redirect_url)

**DO NOT proceed with implementation until you have confirmed ALL of the above information with the user.**

If any information is missing, ask specific questions and wait for responses before continuing. This prevents errors and ensures the integration matches the user's exact requirements.

## Next Steps
After completing basic authentication integration:
- Test the authentication flow with /auth/login
- Verify protected routes work correctly
- Update URLs for production deployment
- Add additional protected endpoints as needed
