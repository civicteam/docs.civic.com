You won't see any surprises when building with Civic Auth.&#x20;

Our pricing is simple and transparent, made to help builders focus on their product early on and not worry about complex policies as you scale.&#x20;

You only pay for active users that add value to your application, and that's after the first 15,000 MAUs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a Web3 builder, see the [Web3 Pricing](web3/auth-+-embedded-wallets-pricing.md) section for Auth with embedded wallets.
