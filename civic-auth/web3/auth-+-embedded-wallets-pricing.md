# Auth + Embedded Wallets Pricing

You won't see any surprises when building with Civic Auth.&#x20;

Our pricing is simple and transparent, made to help builders focus on their product early on and not worry about complex policies as you scale.&#x20;

You only pay for active users that add value to your application, and that's after the first 2,000 Monthly Active Users (MAUs) with embedded wallets.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users that don't do any transactions or sign any messages are not considered active.
{% endhint %}
