💳 **One Simple Plan**

Get access to all of Nexus with usage-based pricing.

| | **Free Trial** | **Monthly** | **Enterprise** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $0 | $20/month | Contact us |

🎯 **Two Ways to Consume Credits**

**Nexus Chat** — Use Nexus with its LLM via the chat interface. Includes full reasoning and orchestration cost. Best for prototyping, testing integrations, and iterating on multi-step logic.

**Your Own Tooling** — Use Nexus in your chatbot, IDE, or SDK. Credits measure only Nexus orchestration, not your LLM costs. Best for embedding Nexus in apps and automating workflows programmatically.

📊 **What's Included in a Credit?**

Credits measure end-to-end execution cost including LLM compute, tool/API calls (Slack, HubSpot, GitHub, etc.), data handling, and SDK-driven execution.

⚠️ **Credits Do Not Roll Over**

Everything expires at the end of your billing cycle, including if you cancel.
