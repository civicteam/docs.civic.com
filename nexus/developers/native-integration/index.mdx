Civic Nexus can be integrated natively into third-party applications — MCP clients, AI agents, developer tools, and more. Native integrations go beyond simply connecting to Nexus as an end user; they allow your application to handle authentication flows, manage tool calls, and deliver a seamless experience to your users.

## What is a native integration?

A native integration embeds Civic Nexus capabilities directly into your application's runtime. Instead of relying on the LLM to surface authorization links and wait for manual user action, your application can intercept these flows, handle them programmatically, and return results transparently.
