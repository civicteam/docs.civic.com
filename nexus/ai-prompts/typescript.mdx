import TypeScriptPrompt from '/snippets/nexus-typescript.mdx';

Use this prompt with your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) to automatically integrate Civic Nexus into your TypeScript/JavaScript project.

## Prerequisites

Before using this prompt, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Civic Account">
    [Create account](https://nexus.civic.com) and connect your services (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Civic Auth Client ID">
    Get yours at [auth.civic.com](https://auth.civic.com) - you'll need this for the prompt
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your AI SDK">
    Decide which SDK you want to use:
    - **Vercel AI SDK** - Best for Next.js apps with streaming UI
    - **OpenAI Agents SDK** - Simplest setup with automatic tool handling
    - **Anthropic Messages API** - Native MCP support built into the API
  </Step>
  <Step title="TypeScript/JavaScript Project">
    Have a Node.js 18+ or Next.js project ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How This Works

This is a **smart, dynamic prompt** that:

1. **Asks you questions** about your project and which SDK you want to use
2. **Navigates docs.civic.com** to find the latest documentation
3. **Searches for the right guides** based on your SDK choice
4. **Implements the integration** following current best practices
5. **Asks for your Client ID** but never asks for API keys (you add those to .env yourself)

<Note>
**Why dynamic?** Instead of hardcoding documentation URLs, this prompt teaches the AI to navigate and search docs.civic.com. This means it always finds the most up-to-date documentation, even if we update our docs.
</Note>

## How to Use This Prompt

1. **Copy the prompt** below (click the copy icon in the top-right)
2. **Paste into your AI assistant** (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
3. **Answer the questions** the AI asks:
   - Which SDK you want to use
   - Your Civic Auth Client ID (from auth.civic.com)
   - Your project details (framework, router type, etc.)
4. **Let the AI navigate docs** and implement the integration
5. **Add your API keys** to `.env.local` when prompted

## What the AI Assistant Will Do

When you use this prompt, the AI assistant will:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather Information">
    Asks which SDK you want, your Client ID, and project details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate Documentation">
    Searches docs.civic.com for Nexus recipes and Civic Auth guides
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Environment">
    Creates .env.local with your Client ID and tells you to add API keys
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Civic Auth">
    Sets up authentication based on your framework
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Nexus Integration">
    Follows the recipe for your chosen SDK (Vercel, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Verify">
    Guides you to test the integration with a simple query
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SDK Options

The prompt supports three integration approaches:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Vercel AI SDK" icon="triangle">
    **Best for:** Next.js apps with streaming UI

    **Approach:** Manual tool looping with execute functions

    [Manual Recipe →](/nexus/recipes/vercel-ai-sdk)
  </Card>
  <Card title="OpenAI Agents SDK" icon="robot">
    **Best for:** Quick prototypes, simplest setup

    **Approach:** hostedMcpTool() - automatic tool handling

    [Manual Recipe →](/nexus/recipes/openai-agents)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Anthropic Messages API" icon="message">
    **Best for:** Direct API usage with Claude

    **Approach:** Native mcp_servers parameter

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Important Notes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client ID Required">
    The AI will ask for your Civic Auth Client ID. Have it ready from [auth.civic.com](https://auth.civic.com).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API Keys Handled Separately">
    The AI will NEVER ask you for your OpenAI or Anthropic API keys. It will tell you to add them to `.env.local` yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dynamic Documentation">
    The AI navigates and searches docs.civic.com instead of using hardcoded URLs. This keeps the integration up-to-date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Framework Flexibility">
    Works with Next.js, Node.js, and other TypeScript/JavaScript frameworks. The AI adapts to your setup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Supported AI Assistants

This prompt works with any AI assistant that can:
- Navigate and search websites
- Read documentation dynamically
- Write code and create files
- Install npm packages
- Understand TypeScript/JavaScript

Popular options:
- **Claude** (via Claude.ai or Claude Code)
- **ChatGPT** (with web browsing or Code Interpreter)
- **Cursor** (built-in AI assistant)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat**
- **Windsurf**
- **Cline**

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Can't Find Documentation">
    - Make sure the AI has web access
    - Try being more explicit: "Navigate to docs.civic.com and search for Nexus"
    - Check that the AI is starting from docs.civic.com (not civic.com or other sites)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Not Working">
    - Verify CIVIC_AUTH_CLIENT_ID is in .env.local
    - Check that the value matches your Client ID from auth.civic.com
    - For Next.js: Ensure middleware.ts is in src/ directory
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tool Calls Failing">
    - Confirm services are connected at nexus.civic.com
    - Check that user is authenticated (has access token)
    - Verify the Nexus endpoint: https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
