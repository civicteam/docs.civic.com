# AI-Assisted Nexus Integration

Use AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, or other LLMs to automatically integrate Civic Nexus into your AI application. These prompts provide step-by-step instructions that AI assistants can follow to connect your AI agents to external tools and services through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Choose Your AI SDK

Select the SDK you're using in your project:

## How to Use These Prompts

### Step 1: Prerequisites
Before using any prompt, ensure you have:
1. **Civic Account** - [Create account](https://nexus.civic.com)
2. **Connected Services** - Connect GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc. at [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com)
3. **Civic Auth Client ID** - Get yours at [auth.civic.com](https://auth.civic.com)
4. **AI Provider API Key** - OpenAI, Anthropic, or compatible provider

### Step 2: Choose Your SDK
Pick the AI SDK that matches your project:
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Best for Next.js projects with streaming UI
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** - Simplest integration with hosted MCP tools
- **Anthropic Messages API** - Direct API integration with native MCP support

### Step 3: Copy and Paste
1. Navigate to the appropriate prompt page
2. Copy the entire prompt
3. Paste it into your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
4. Follow the AI's step-by-step instructions

## What These Prompts Will Do

When you use these prompts, the AI assistant will:

1. **Fetch Complete Documentation** - Uses curl to get the latest Nexus integration guides
2. **Set Up Authentication** - Configures Civic Auth to get access tokens for Nexus
3. **Install Dependencies** - Adds required packages for your chosen SDK
4. **Create MCP Client** - Sets up connection to `https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp`
5. **Wire Up Tools** - Connects Nexus tools to your AI SDK (approach varies by SDK)
6. **Handle Streaming** - Implements proper streaming responses (where applicable)
7. **Add Error Handling** - Includes robust error handling and client cleanup

## Tips for Best Results

<Warning>
Always review the AI-generated code before implementing it in production. While these prompts are designed to produce working code, it's important to understand what's being added to your project.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Start with the starter template** - Clone [ai-chatbot](https://github.com/civicteam/ai-chatbot) if you're starting fresh
- **One SDK at a time** - Don't try to implement multiple SDKs simultaneously
- **Test with one tool** - Start by calling a single Nexus tool before expanding
- **Environment variables** - Keep your Client ID and API keys secure
- **Error handling** - Ensure proper client cleanup in all code paths
- **Review the docs** - Check the manual integration guides if you need more context

## Need Manual Integration?

If you prefer to integrate manually or need more control over the process, check out our [Recipes](/nexus/recipes/vercel-ai-sdk) for step-by-step code examples.

## Supported AI Assistants

These prompts work with any AI assistant that can:
- Execute curl commands to fetch documentation
- Read and write files in your project
- Install npm packages
- Understand TypeScript/JavaScript

Popular options include:
- **Claude** (via Claude.ai or Claude Code)
- **ChatGPT** (with Code Interpreter)
- **Cursor** (built-in AI assistant)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat**
- **Windsurf**
- **Cline**
