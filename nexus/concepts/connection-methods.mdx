## Two Ways to Connect

There are two ways your AI client can connect to Nexus servers. The method depends on what your AI client supports:

## Remote URL Method

**Simple copy/paste connection** for clients that support remote MCP servers.

### How it works:
1. Visit nexus.civic.com and select your tools
2. Copy the MCP URL: `https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp`
3. Paste into your AI client's MCP settings
4. Your client connects directly to Nexus servers

### Supported clients:
- Claude Desktop
- Claude.ai (Web)
- Goose
- Any client with "remote MCP URL" or "HTTP connector" options

### Advantages:
- ✅ **Simplest setup** - just copy and paste
- ✅ **No local software** needed
- ✅ **Automatic updates** - always uses latest version
- ✅ **Works across devices** - same URL everywhere

### Connection flow:
```
Your AI Client ←→ Internet ←→ Nexus Servers ←→ Your Tools
```

## Hub Bridge Method

**Local proxy connection** for clients that only support local MCP servers.

### How it works:
1. Configure your client to run `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge` as a local MCP server
2. Your client thinks it's connecting to a local server
3. The bridge forwards requests to Nexus servers
4. Bridge handles all authentication and token management

### Supported clients:
- Cursor (one-click install)
- VS Code (one-click install)
- JetBrains IDEs (manual setup)
- Windsurf (manual setup)
- Claude Code (auto-install: `npx @civic/hub-bridge install claude-code`)
- Any client with only "local MCP" or "stdio" options

### Advantages:
- ✅ **Universal compatibility** - works with any MCP client
- ✅ **Local control** - bridge runs on your machine
- ✅ **Transparent authentication** - handles OAuth flows automatically
- ✅ **Offline capability** - cached tokens work briefly offline

### Connection flow:
```
Your AI Client ←→ Hub Bridge (local) ←→ Internet ←→ Nexus Servers ←→ Your Tools
```

## How to Tell Which Method You Need

### Check your AI client's settings:

**Use Remote URL if you see:**
- "Remote MCP server"
- "HTTP MCP URL" 
- "MCP connector URL"
- "External MCP server"

**Use Hub Bridge if you see:**
- "Local MCP server"
- "Command/stdio"
- "MCP executable"
- "Local process"

### Quick test:
If your client asks for a command and arguments (like `npx` and `[@civic/hub-bridge]`), you need Hub Bridge. If it asks for a URL, you can use Remote URL.

## Why Two Methods?

### MCP Client Limitations

Not all AI clients support all MCP features:

**Remote URL requirements:**
- HTTP/HTTPS network requests
- OAuth authentication handling
- Token refresh management
- Remote server connections

**Hub Bridge compatibility:**
- Only needs local process spawning
- Bridge handles all network complexity
- Works with any stdio-based MCP client

### Technical Differences

**Remote URL clients:**
- Native MCP HTTP protocol support
- Built-in OAuth handling
- Direct network connectivity
- Usually newer or more advanced clients

**Hub Bridge clients:**
- stdio/process-based MCP only
- No built-in authentication
- Local-only MCP support
- Often development tools or older clients

## Authentication Methods

Nexus supports two authentication approaches depending on how you're connecting:

### Browser Authentication

**For:** Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible agents

When connecting through Remote URL or Hub Bridge, Nexus uses browser-based OAuth authentication:
- You authenticate through your browser when connecting
- Works with all MCP-compatible AI assistants
- Secure OAuth flow with automatic token refresh
- No manual token management required

### Token-Based Authentication

**For:** Services that require an access token upfront

Some services and platforms cannot use browser-based OAuth flows and need a token provided upfront, such as OpenAI Agent Builder, n8n, and custom applications.

</Card>

**Quick overview:**
- Generate time-limited tokens (1-30 days) from your Nexus dashboard
- Use tokens for server-side integrations that can't use browser OAuth
- Tokens are profile-scoped and revocable at any time

### Authentication Differences by Method

**Remote URL Authentication:**
- Your client handles OAuth directly
- You authorize in your client's interface
- Client manages token storage and refresh

**Hub Bridge Authentication:**
- Bridge handles all OAuth flows
- You authorize in your browser (opened by bridge)
- Bridge manages tokens locally and refreshes automatically

**Token-Based Authentication:**
- You generate a token in Nexus dashboard
- Provide the token to your service/platform
- Token valid until expiration (1-30 days)
- Manually refresh or regenerate as needed

## When to Use Each Method

### Choose Remote URL when:
- Your client supports it (check settings for "remote MCP URL")
- You want the simplest setup
- You use multiple devices
- You prefer cloud-based management

### Choose Hub Bridge when:
- Your client only supports local/stdio MCP
- You're using development tools (IDEs, CLIs)
- You want local control over connections
- Your client doesn't support OAuth

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Remote URL problems:
- **Client doesn't connect**: Check if client supports remote MCP URLs
- **Authentication fails**: Verify client has OAuth capabilities
- **URL not accepted**: Try Hub Bridge method instead

### Hub Bridge problems:
- **Command not found**: Install Node.js 18+
- **Bridge won't start**: Check terminal permissions and network access
- **Authentication hangs**: Ensure browser can open and corporate firewalls aren't blocking

## Both Methods Work the Same

Once connected, **your AI experience is identical** regardless of connection method:
- Same tools and capabilities
- Same authentication to individual services
- Same performance and reliability
- Same security and privacy protections

The connection method is just plumbing - what matters is that your AI can access your tools!
