## What is OAuth?

OAuth is a secure way for apps to access your accounts in other services without ever seeing your password. When you connect Nexus to GitHub, Slack, or Dropbox, you're using OAuth.

## How It Works

Instead of giving Nexus your GitHub password, OAuth works like this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Permission Request">
    Nexus says "I'd like to access your GitHub repos"
  </Step>
  <Step title="You Authorize">
    GitHub asks you "Allow Nexus to access your repos?" and you click "Yes"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Token">
    GitHub gives Nexus a special token (not your password) that proves you said "yes"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Granted">
    Nexus uses the token to access your repos on your behalf
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why OAuth is Safer

**With passwords:**
- ❌ Apps store your actual password
- ❌ If they get hacked, your password is exposed
- ❌ Hard to revoke access
- ❌ App can do anything your account can do

**With OAuth:**
- ✅ Apps never see your password
- ✅ You can revoke access anytime
- ✅ Limited permissions (read repos, not delete account)
- ✅ Tokens expire automatically

## OAuth in Nexus

When you first use a tool in Nexus:

1. **Chat Interface**: Your AI will ask you to authorize the service
2. **Quick Authorization**: Click to approve the specific permissions needed
3. **One-Time Setup**: You only need to do this once per service
4. **Automatic Management**: Nexus handles token refresh and renewal

## Managing Your Authorizations

You can always:
- **View connected services** in your Nexus dashboard
- **Revoke access** to any service instantly
- **Re-authorize** if you need different permissions
- **See what permissions** each service has

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="What happens if I revoke access to a service?">
The service immediately stops working in your AI assistant. You can re-authorize it anytime by using a command that requires that service.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Nexus store my passwords?">
No, never. Nexus only stores OAuth tokens, which are secure, limited-permission keys that don't contain any password information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I limit what permissions Nexus gets?">
Yes! During the OAuth flow, you can often choose which permissions to grant. For example, you might allow read access to repositories but not write access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do authorizations last?">
OAuth tokens typically last 1-24 hours before automatic refresh. If you don't use a service for extended periods, you may need to re-authorize.
</Accordion>

## Security Best Practices

- **Review permissions** before clicking "Authorize"
- **Revoke unused services** periodically in your Nexus dashboard
- **Use specific permissions** rather than granting broad access
- **Monitor your connected services** to ensure you recognize them all

OAuth keeps your accounts secure while letting your AI assistant do useful work across all your tools.
