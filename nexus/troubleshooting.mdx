## Quick Diagnostics

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Connection Method">
    **Remote URL:** Does your client show the Civic Nexus connector in settings?  
    **Hub Bridge:** Run `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --status` to check bridge health
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Authentication">
    Try a simple command: `"What MCP servers are available?"` or `"List available tools"`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Server Selection">
    Visit nexus.civic.com to confirm you've selected and authorized the servers you want to use
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Primary Client Issues (ChatGPT & Claude)

### 401 Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized - ChatGPT/Claude Connector" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:** "Unauthorized", "Authentication failed", or "Invalid credentials" when adding MCP connector
    
    **For Claude Desktop/Claude.ai:**
    - Ensure you have Claude Pro, Team, or Enterprise (MCP not available on free plan)
    - Check that you're signed into your Claude account
    - Remove and re-add the Civic Nexus connector with fresh URL
    - Clear browser cache and cookies for claude.ai
    - Verify the MCP URL is correct: `https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp`
    
    **For ChatGPT (when available):**
    - Ensure you have ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise
    - Check that MCP connectors are enabled in your subscription
    - Clear browser cache for chatgpt.com
    - Try incognito/private browsing mode
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="401 During Tool Usage" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:** Connector connects but tools return "Unauthorized" errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Visit [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com) and ensure you've authorized the specific services (GitHub, Slack, etc.)

    - Re-authorize individual services: ask your AI "Connect me to GitHub"
    - Verify you have the required permissions (repo access, workspace membership, etc.)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 404 Not Found Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="404 Connector Not Found" icon="link-slash">
    **Symptoms:** "Connector not found", "Invalid URL", or "Service unavailable" when adding connector
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Double-check the MCP URL is exactly: `https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp`
    - Ensure you have created an account at [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com)

    - Service may be temporarily unavailable - try again later
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connector shows as disconnected" icon="link-slash">

## Developer Tool Issues (Hub Bridge)

### Hub Bridge Issues  

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command not found errors" icon="terminal">
    **Symptoms:** `npx: command not found` or `'npx' is not recognized`
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Install Node.js 18+ from nodejs.org
    - Restart terminal/IDE after Node.js installation  
    - Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`
    - On Windows: restart Command Prompt/PowerShell as Administrator
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bridge downloads but fails to start" icon="download">
    **Symptoms:** Bridge downloads but immediately exits or shows errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check Node.js version: must be 18 or higher
    - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
    - Try manual install: `npm install -g @civic/hub-bridge`
    - Check permissions - bridge needs to write to cache directory
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication browser doesn't open" icon="browser">
    **Symptoms:** Bridge starts but browser window doesn't appear for auth
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Corporate firewall blocking - try from personal network first
    - Manually visit auth URL shown in terminal output
    - Set default browser if none configured
    - Disable VPN temporarily during initial setup
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Client can't connect to bridge" icon="plug-disconnected">
    **Symptoms:** Client shows MCP errors or "server not responding"
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify exact command: `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge` (note the `-y` flag)
    - Restart client completely after configuring bridge
    - Check client MCP settings use "stdio" type, not "http"
    - Some clients need manual MCP restart after configuration changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repeated login prompts" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:** Keep getting asked to sign in despite successful authentication
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check system clock is accurate (OAuth tokens are time-sensitive)
    - Clear browser cookies for civic.com and nexus.civic.com
    - **Hub Bridge:** Run `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --reset` to clear cache
    - **Remote URL:** Remove and re-add the connector in your client
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="OAuth errors from connected services" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:** "Invalid scope", "Access denied", or "Token expired" for GitHub/Slack/etc.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Revisit nexus.civic.com and re-authorize the specific service
    - Check service account permissions (e.g., GitHub org access, Slack workspace admin)
    - Some services require re-authorization after permission changes
    - Token may have been revoked - re-authorize to generate new one
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="403/401 errors" icon="lock">
    **Symptoms:** "Unauthorized" or "Forbidden" errors when using MCP commands
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Service tokens may have expired - re-authorize at nexus.civic.com
    - Check rate limits - wait a few minutes and try again
    - Verify you have required permissions (repo access, channel membership, etc.)
    - Contact admin if using workspace/organization accounts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slow responses" icon="hourglass">
    **Symptoms:** MCP commands take a long time to complete
    
    **Solutions:**
    - First request to each service is slower (authentication)
    - Large operations (file uploads, bulk queries) are inherently slow
    - **Hub Bridge:** Responses cached for 1 hour to improve speed
    - Check network connection - corporate proxies can add latency
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Timeouts" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:** Commands fail with timeout errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Break large requests into smaller chunks
    - Some services have strict rate limits (GitHub API: 5,000/hour)
    - **Hub Bridge:** Increase timeout with `CIVIC_BRIDGE_AUTH_TIMEOUT=600`
    - Try the same command later - may be temporary service issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Client-Specific Issues

### Claude Desktop

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connector shows as disconnected" icon="claude">
    **Solutions:**
    - Update Claude Desktop to latest version

    - Check macOS system preferences allow Claude network access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Cursor

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP features not working after install" icon="cursor">
    **Solutions:**

    - Reload VS Code window after MCP configuration changes
    - Verify extension has proper permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Corporate Network Issues

Many issues stem from corporate security policies:

<Warning>
**Common corporate restrictions that affect Nexus:**
- Proxy servers intercepting HTTPS requests
- Firewall blocking npm/Node.js downloads  
- TLS certificate inspection causing SSL errors
- OAuth redirect URLs blocked by content filters
</Warning>

**Solutions:**
- Work with IT to whitelist `*.civic.com`, `*.npmjs.org`, and `*.nodejs.org`
- Try initial setup from personal network, then switch to corporate
- Request proxy bypass for development tools
- Use company VPN if external setup works
