    - Re-authorize individual services: ask your AI "Connect me to GitHub"
    - Verify you have the required permissions (repo access, workspace membership, etc.)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 404 Not Found Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="404 Connector Not Found" icon="link-slash">
    **Symptoms:** "Connector not found", "Invalid URL", or "Service unavailable" when adding connector
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Double-check the MCP URL is exactly: `https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp`
    - Ensure you have created an account at [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com)
    - Check your internet connection and try again
    - Corporate firewall may be blocking - try from personal network
    - Wait a few minutes and retry (temporary service issues)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="404 During Tool Usage" icon="server">
    **Symptoms:** Connector works but specific tools return "Not Found" errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check that you selected the required MCP servers at nexus.civic.com
    - Some tools require specific service permissions - re-authorize the service
    - Try asking: "What MCP servers are available?" to see current connections
    - Service may be temporarily unavailable - try again later
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connector shows as disconnected" icon="link-slash">

  <Accordion title="Authentication popup blocked" icon="shield">
    **Symptoms:** Client tries to connect but no auth window appears
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Allow popups for your client (Claude Desktop/ChatGPT)
    - Try connecting from a different network (corporate firewalls may block)
    - Clear client cache/settings and re-add the connector
    - Use incognito/private browsing mode for web clients
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools don't appear after connecting" icon="server">
    **Symptoms:** Connection succeeds but no MCP tools are visible
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Restart your client completely after initial setup
    - Check nexus.civic.com - make sure you selected MCP servers
    - Ask your AI: "What MCP tools are available?" to verify connection
    - Complete OAuth flows for each service you want to use
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repeated login prompts" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:** Keep getting asked to sign in despite successful authentication
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check system clock is accurate (OAuth tokens are time-sensitive)
    - Clear browser cookies for civic.com and nexus.civic.com
    - Remove and re-add the connector in your client
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="OAuth errors from connected services" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:** "Invalid scope", "Access denied", or "Token expired" for GitHub/Slack/etc.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Revisit nexus.civic.com and re-authorize the specific service
    - Check service account permissions (e.g., GitHub org access, Slack workspace admin)
    - Some services require re-authorization after permission changes
    - Token may have been revoked - re-authorize to generate new one
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="403/401 errors" icon="lock">
    **Symptoms:** "Unauthorized" or "Forbidden" errors when using MCP commands
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Service tokens may have expired - re-authorize at nexus.civic.com
    - Check rate limits - wait a few minutes and try again
    - Verify you have required permissions (repo access, channel membership, etc.)
    - Contact admin if using workspace/organization accounts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slow responses" icon="hourglass">
    **Symptoms:** MCP commands take a long time to complete
    
    **Solutions:**
    - First request to each service is slower (authentication)
    - Large operations (file uploads, bulk queries) are inherently slow
    - Check network connection - corporate proxies can add latency
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Timeouts" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:** Commands fail with timeout errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Break large requests into smaller chunks
    - Some services have strict rate limits (GitHub API: 5,000/hour)
    - Try the same command later - may be temporary service issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Client-Specific Issues

### Claude Desktop

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connector shows as disconnected" icon="claude">
    **Solutions:**
    - Update Claude Desktop to latest version

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools not working or unavailable" icon="tools">
    **Symptoms:** Claude shows connected but can't access your tools, or tools are missing
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check connector status:** In Claude Desktop settings, verify Civic Nexus connector shows "Connected"
    2. **Verify tool access:** Ask Claude "What MCP tools are available?" to see current tools
    3. **Reauthorize if needed:** If tools are missing:
       - Go to Claude Desktop → Settings → Connectors
       - Find Civic Nexus connector and click on it
       - If prompted to "Connect" or "Authorize", click it to reauthorize
       - Complete any OAuth flows that appear
    4. **Restart Claude:** Close and reopen Claude Desktop after reauthorization
    5. **Test again:** Try using a simple tool command to verify access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Cursor

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP features not working after install" icon="cursor">
    **Solutions:**
    - Restart Cursor completely (not just reload window)
    - Check Cursor Settings → Features → MCP is enabled
    - Try disabling and re-enabling Civic Nexus in MCP settings
    - Update Cursor to latest version
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### VS Code

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP extension not loading" icon="code">

    - Check VS Code settings: search "MCP" and enable required features
    - Reload VS Code window after MCP configuration changes
    - Verify extension has proper permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Corporate Network Issues

Many issues stem from corporate security policies:

<Warning>
**Common corporate restrictions that affect Nexus:**
- Proxy servers intercepting HTTPS requests  
- TLS certificate inspection causing SSL errors
- OAuth redirect URLs blocked by content filters
</Warning>

**Solutions:**
- Work with IT to whitelist `*.civic.com` 
- Try initial setup from personal network, then switch to corporate
- Request proxy bypass for MCP connectors
- Use company VPN if external setup works

## Account Management

### Converting Your Personal Account to an Organization

If you want to convert your Personal Nexus account to an Organization account:

1. Click on your profile name in the bottom left corner of the screen
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Go to **Members**
4. Click the **'Convert to organization'** button
5. Choose your organization name in the modal and click **'Convert to organization'** to complete
6. You should see an **'Account converted to organization successfully'** message

After conversion, you'll be able to invite team members to collaborate. Your existing data and settings will be preserved.

<Warning>
**Important:**

- Once you've converted your personal account to an organization, this change is permanent.
- Only one account type is allowed per email address or login method. You cannot have both a Personal account and an Organization account associated with the same email address or login method.
- If you have an Organization account, you cannot convert it to a personal account. You will need to create a separate personal account using a different email address.
</Warning>

If you encounter any issues converting your account, please reach out to our support team via email at [support@civic.com](mailto:support@civic.com) using the email address associated with your account. Include a description of your issue, any troubleshooting steps you've tried, and provide screenshots or a screen recording.
