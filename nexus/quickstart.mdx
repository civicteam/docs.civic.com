## Step 2: Add the connector to Claude Desktop

After selecting your MCP servers, you'll need to add them to Claude Desktop:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the MCP URL">
    On ai.civic.com, look for the MCP URL that appears after you've selected servers. It will look something like:

    Click the copy button to copy this URL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Claude Desktop settings">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add MCP connector">
    1. Look for "MCP Connectors" or similar option
    2. Click "Add Connector" or the "+" button
    3. Paste the MCP URL you copied from ai.civic.com
    4. Give your connector a name (e.g., "Civic Nexus")
    5. Click "Save" or "Add"

      alt="Claude Desktop MCP connector settings"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Authenticate and start using

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete authentication">
    When you first use an MCP server that requires authentication:
    1. Claude will prompt you to connect to the service
    2. A browser window will open for OAuth authentication
    3. Sign in to the service and authorize access
    4. Return to Claude Desktop when complete
    
    <Note>
      Authentication is handled securely by Civic Nexus. Your credentials are never exposed to Claude or stored locally.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your connection">
    Try a simple command to verify everything is working:
    
    ```
    "Can you check my recent Slack messages?"
    ```
    
    or
    
    ```
    "What's in my Google Drive?"
    ```
    
    Claude should now be able to access and interact with your connected services.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if authentication fails?">
    If you encounter authentication issues:
    - Make sure you're logged into the correct account for the service
    - Check if your account email matches between ai.civic.com and the service
    - Try removing and re-adding the MCP connector
    - For persistent issues, try using [Hub Bridge](/nexus/hub-bridge) as an alternative
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need a paid Claude plan?">
    Yes, MCP connectors are currently only available on Claude Pro and Team plans. The free Claude plan doesn't support external integrations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use different email addresses?">
    If your ai.civic.com account uses a different email than your connected services (e.g., nancy@civic.com vs nancynli@gmail.com), you may need to ensure you're authenticating with the correct account for each service.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What about other AI assistants?">
    Civic Nexus works with many AI platforms including ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, and more. See our [client compatibility guide](/nexus/reference/client-compatibility) for setup instructions for other platforms.
