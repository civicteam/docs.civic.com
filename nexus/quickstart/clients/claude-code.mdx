  Claude Code connects to Civic Nexus through the Hub Bridge MCP server. Follow the steps below to pair the two tools in a few minutes.
</Callout>

## Overview

Claude Code (Anthropic's command-line coding assistant) uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to talk to external tools. Civic Nexus exposes its functionality through the `@civic/hub-bridge` MCP server, which you can register with the Claude CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Anthropic Claude CLI (`claude`) installed and authenticated
- Node.js 18 or newer (required for `npx @civic/hub-bridge`)
- Civic Nexus account with access to Hub Bridge

## Quick Setup

Claude Code supports two connection methods. Choose the one that works best for you:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTP Transport (Recommended)">
    ### Direct Connection via HTTP

    Claude Code now supports direct HTTP connections to Nexus without needing a local bridge.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Register the Civic server with HTTP transport">
        Run this command to add Civic Nexus via HTTP:

        ```bash
        claude mcp add --transport http civic https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp
        ```

        This configures Claude Code to connect directly to Nexus over HTTP.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch Claude Code">
        Start the Claude CLI session:

        ```bash
        claude
        ```

        Tip: add the `--debug` flag if you want to watch MCP logs while connecting.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect and sign in">
        Inside the Claude session, run the MCP menu command:

        ```text
        /mcp
        ```

        Select the `civic` server and follow the browser sign-in flow to authorize Civic Nexus. Once the login completes, Claude confirms that the server is available for tool execution.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hub Bridge (Alternative)">
    ### Local Bridge Connection

    If you prefer using the Hub Bridge or encounter issues with HTTP transport, you can use the local bridge method.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Register the Civic server">
        Run this command to add the Civic Hub Bridge MCP server:

        ```bash
        claude mcp add civic "npx @civic/hub-bridge"
        ```

        This installs the bridge (if needed) and stores the connection in your Claude MCP config.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch Claude Code">
        Start the Claude CLI session:

        ```bash
        claude
        ```

        Tip: add the `--debug` flag if you want to watch MCP logs while connecting.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect and sign in">
        Inside the Claude session, run the MCP menu command:

        ```text
        /mcp
        ```

        Select the `civic` server and follow the browser sign-in flow to authorize Civic Nexus. Once the login completes, Claude confirms that the server is available for tool execution.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify the Connection

- In Claude, run `/mcp` again to check that `civic` shows as `connected`
- Test a Civic command (for example, request a tool list) to confirm the session is authorized

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection shows `failed`, re-run `claude --debug` to view detailed logs in your terminal
- Ensure you have an active Civic session in your default browser; the MCP flow opens a new window for login
- Delete and re-add the server with `claude mcp remove civic` followed by the setup command if you need to refresh credentials
