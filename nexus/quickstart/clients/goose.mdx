## Setup with Remote HTTP Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your MCP URL">
    1. Sign in to [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com)
    2. Select the MCP servers you want to use
    3. Copy the MCP URL: `https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Goose">
    Add the Civic Nexus MCP server to your Goose configuration:

    1. Open your Goose configuration file (typically `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` or project-specific `.goose/config.yaml`)
    2. Add the following MCP server configuration:

    ```yaml
    mcp:
      servers:
        civic-nexus:
          type: http
          url: https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp
          name: "Civic Nexus"
    ```

    <Note>
      Goose supports HTTP endpoints directly, no local bridge required.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Goose">
    Restart Goose to load the new configuration:
    ```bash
    goose restart
    ```
    Or if running as a service:
    ```bash
    goose stop
    goose start
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify the connection is working:
    ```
    "What MCP servers are available?"
    "Show me my connected tools"
    ```

    Goose should respond with the list of available Civic Nexus tools.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate Services">
    When you first use a tool that requires authentication:
    1. Goose will prompt you to authorize access
    2. A browser window will open for OAuth authentication
    3. Sign in to the service and authorize access
    4. Return to Goose when complete

    <Note>
      Authentication is handled securely by Civic Nexus. Your credentials are never exposed to Goose or stored locally.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative: Hub Bridge Setup

If you prefer to use the local Hub Bridge instead of direct HTTP endpoints:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Hub Bridge">
    Add this to your Goose configuration:

    ```yaml
    mcp:
      servers:
        civic-nexus:
          type: stdio
          command: npx
          args: ["-y", "@civic/hub-bridge"]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Node.js">
    Make sure Node.js 18+ is installed for the Hub Bridge to work
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart and Test">
    Restart Goose and test with: "What MCP servers are available?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
