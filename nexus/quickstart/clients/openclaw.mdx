<Callout icon="shield-check" color="green">
  This guide sets up Civic Nexus as an MCP gateway for OpenClaw, giving you secure, revocable access to external services without storing credentials on your machine.
</Callout>

## Why Use Nexus with OpenClaw?

- **No browser automation** — explicit authorization instead of implicit access
- **No credentials on host** — tokens live in Nexus, not on your machine
- **Lower token usage** — more cost-effective than browser-based approaches
- **Instant revocation** — disable access anytime from Nexus
- **Centralized control** — manage all permissions in one place

## Quick Setup

The fastest way to get started is using our pre-configured OpenClaw toolkit prompt.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the setup prompt in Nexus">
    Visit the OpenClaw toolkit configuration:

    <Card title="OpenClaw Quick Setup" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="https://nexus.civic.com/web/accounts/a2ae6632-f4cb-405a-8de1-b58d63c5ef43/profiles/7260dfca-89e6-4e53-a42a-120df1675501">
      Launch the pre-configured OpenClaw toolkit in Nexus
    </Card>

    This creates a toolkit with Gmail and Google Calendar in **safety mode** (read-only by default).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize the services">
    Follow the prompts to authorize Gmail and Calendar access. You'll be redirected to Google to grant permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your MCP URL and token">
    After setup, Nexus provides:
    - **MCP Gateway URL** — safe to share (not secret)
    - **Access Token** — keep this private

    Copy both values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OpenClaw">
    Add the credentials to your OpenClaw environment. Create or edit `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`:

    ```bash
    NEXUS_URL="https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp?accountId=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID&profile=openclaw"
    NEXUS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
    ```

    Or configure via `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "skills": {
        "entries": {
          "nexus-mcp-bridge": {
            "enabled": true,
            "env": {
              "NEXUS_URL": "your-mcp-url",
              "NEXUS_TOKEN": "your-access-token"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the connection">
    In OpenClaw, ask:

    ```text
    List the MCP tools I have access to
    ```

    You should see Gmail and Calendar tools listed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Included in Safety Mode

The quick setup configures these defaults:

| Service | Allowed | Blocked |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Gmail** | Read emails, search, create drafts | Send emails |
| **Calendar** | View events, check availability | Create, modify, delete events |

<Accordion title="Why safety mode?">
  Safety mode prevents accidental actions while you're getting familiar with the integration. You can enable full access anytime by modifying the toolkit filters in Nexus.
</Accordion>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure everything yourself or want different permissions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Nexus account">
    Go to [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com) and sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new toolkit">
    1. Click **Create Toolkit**
    2. Name it (e.g., "openclaw" or "my-assistant")
    3. Switch to this toolkit for the following steps
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add MCP servers">
    Add the tools you want OpenClaw to access:

    - **Gmail** (`gmail`) — email access
    - **Google Calendar** (`calendar`) — calendar access
    - **Google Drive** (`google-drive`) — file access
    - **PostgreSQL** (`postgresql`) — database queries
    - [See all 100+ available servers](/nexus/reference/servers)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure filters (optional)">
    Use Hook Filters to restrict specific actions:

    **Gmail read-only:**
    ```json
    {"disabled": ["send_gmail_message"]}
    ```

    **Calendar read-only:**
    ```json
    {"disabled": ["create_event", "modify_event", "delete_event"]}
    ```

    Or enable full access by leaving filters empty.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate your access token">
    In your Nexus profile settings, generate a **private access token**.

    <Callout icon="lock" color="red">
      Never share this token or paste it into chat. Store it securely.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OpenClaw">
    Add credentials to `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`:

    ```bash
    NEXUS_URL="your-mcp-gateway-url"
    NEXUS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authorization Flow

When OpenClaw tries to use a tool for the first time, you'll see an authorization prompt:

<Steps>
  <Step title="OpenClaw requests access">
    Ask OpenClaw something like:

    ```text
    Check any meetings I have tomorrow
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve in Nexus">
    OpenClaw will provide an authorization link. Open it and approve access in your browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm completion">
    Return to OpenClaw and say:

    ```text
    Done
    ```

    OpenClaw now has access to that service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Access

You stay in control at all times.

### View active permissions

In Nexus, go to **Authorizations** to see all active connections.

### Revoke access

Click **Revoke** on any authorization to immediately disable access. No host login required — revocation is instant.

### Modify filters

Edit your toolkit's Hook Filters to enable or disable specific actions without revoking the entire connection.

## Installing the Skill

For the best experience, install the Nexus MCP Bridge skill:

```bash
clawhub install nexus-mcp-bridge
```

This skill teaches OpenClaw how to use Nexus tools and handles the connection automatically.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'NEXUS_TOKEN environment variable is required'">
    Make sure you've added the token to your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    export NEXUS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
    ```

    Then restart OpenClaw.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Authorization required' error">
    Some tools need OAuth authorization on first use. Click the authorization URL provided and complete the flow, then tell OpenClaw "Done".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token expired">
    Tokens last approximately 30 days. Generate a fresh token from your Nexus profile settings if you see authentication errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection timeout">
    API calls through Nexus can take 10-15 seconds due to server-side processing. This is normal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
