## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add to Cursor'">
    Use the one-click install button below:
    
    <a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Civic%20Nexus&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBjaXZpYy9odWItYnJpZGdlIn0%3D">
      <img
        src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg"
        alt="Add Civic Nexus to Cursor"
        width="126"
        height="28"
        className="rounded hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity"
      />
    </a>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install in Cursor">
    When Cursor opens, click "Install" to add the Civic Nexus MCP server
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable the Connection">
    Make sure Civic Nexus is enabled in Cursor's MCP settings. If you don't see it, try disabling and re-enabling it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="First-Time Authentication">
    The first time you use any MCP command, the Hub Bridge will:
    - Automatically download and install itself
    - Handle authentication directly in the chat interface  
    - Let you select which tools to connect from nexus.civic.com
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Your Connection

Try these prompts in Cursor to verify everything works:

```
"What MCP servers are available?"
"Show me my connected tools"
"Help me set up GitHub integration"
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Cursor doesn't open when I click the install button">
Make sure Cursor is installed and try copying this URL manually:
```
cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Civic%20Nexus&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBjaXZpYy9odWItYnJpZGdlIn0%3D
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Node.js not found' error">
Install Node.js 18 or later from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and restart Cursor.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication window doesn't open">
The Hub Bridge should handle authentication in the chat. If it doesn't:
1. Restart Cursor
2. Try disabling and re-enabling Civic Nexus in Cursor settings
3. Make sure you're trying to use a tool that requires authentication
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Civic Nexus not showing in Cursor settings">
1. Make sure you clicked "Install" when prompted
2. Check Cursor's MCP server settings manually
3. Try the manual setup method below
</Accordion>

## Manual Setup (If One-Click Fails)

If the one-click install doesn't work, add Civic Nexus manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cursor Settings">
    Go to Cursor → Settings → Extensions → MCP Servers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add MCP Server">
    Add a new MCP server with these settings:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Civic Nexus",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@civic/hub-bridge"]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable and Test">
    Enable the server and test with: "What MCP servers are available?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
