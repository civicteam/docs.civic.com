  Codex connects to Civic Nexus through the Hub Bridge MCP server. Follow the steps below to pair the two tools in a few minutes.
</Callout>

## Overview

Codex uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to talk to external tools. Civic Nexus exposes its functionality through the `@civic/hub-bridge` MCP server, which you can register with Codex.

## Prerequisites

- Codex installed and authenticated
- Node.js 18 or newer (required for `npx @civic/hub-bridge`)
- Civic Nexus account with access to Hub Bridge

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register the Civic server">
    Run this command to add the Civic Hub Bridge MCP server:

    ```bash
    codex mcp add nexus -- npx -y @civic/hub-bridge
    ```

    This installs the bridge (if needed) and stores the connection in your Codex MCP config.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Codex">
    Start the Codex session:

    ```bash
    codex
    ```

    Tip: add the `--debug` flag if you want to watch MCP logs while connecting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect and sign in">
    Inside the Codex session, run the MCP menu command:

    ```text
    /mcp
    ```

    Select the `nexus` server and follow the browser sign-in flow to authorize Civic Nexus. Once the login completes, Codex confirms that the server is available for tool execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify the Connection

- In Codex, run `/mcp` again to check that `nexus` shows as `connected`
- Test a Civic command (for example, request a tool list) to confirm the session is authorized

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection shows `failed`, re-run `codex --debug` to view detailed logs in your terminal
- Ensure you have an active Civic session in your default browser; the MCP flow opens a new window for login
- Delete and re-add the server with `codex mcp remove nexus` followed by the setup command if you need to refresh credentials
