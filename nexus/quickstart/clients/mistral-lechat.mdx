## Step 3: Authenticate and Test

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete authentication">
    When you first use an MCP server that requires authentication:
    1. LeChat will prompt you to connect to the service
    2. A browser window will open for OAuth authentication
    3. Sign in to the service and authorize access
    4. Return to LeChat when complete

    <Frame caption="OAuth authentication flow (example: GitHub)">
      <img
        className="rounded-lg"
        src="https://placehold.co/600x400/fef3c7/f59e0b?text=GitHub+OAuth%0A%E2%86%93%0AAuthorize+Civic+Nexus%0A%5BAuthorize+Application%5D"
        alt="GitHub OAuth authorization screen"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      Authentication is handled securely by Civic Nexus. Your credentials are never exposed to LeChat or stored locally.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your connection">
    Try these simple commands to verify everything is working:

    ```
    "What MCP servers are available?"
    ```

    Or test a specific service:

    ```
    "Can you check my recent GitHub pull requests?"
    "What's in my Google Drive?"
    ```

    <Frame caption="LeChat successfully using connected tools">
      <img
        className="rounded-lg"
        src="https://placehold.co/700x300/f3e8ff/a855f7?text=LeChat+Conversation%0A%E2%86%93%0A%22Here+are+your+recent+GitHub+PRs%3A%22%0A%E2%80%A2+Fix+login+bug+%28%23123%29%0A%E2%80%A2+Add+new+feature+%28%23124%29"
        alt="LeChat chat showing successful tool usage"
      />
    </Frame>

    LeChat should now be able to access and interact with your connected services.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your MCP Connectors

### Adding More Tools

You can add new tools directly in your LeChat conversation:

```
"Connect me to GitHub"
"Add Slack to my available tools"
"I need access to PostgreSQL"
"Show me what tools are available to connect"
```

LeChat will handle the connection process and guide you through any required authentication steps.

### Viewing Connected Tools

To see your currently connected tools:
1. Go to **Intelligence** → **Connectors** in the left sidebar
2. View the list of active connectors
3. You can see connection status and last used time for each

### Removing Tools

You can disconnect from specific tools:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access connector settings">
    Go to **Intelligence → Connectors** in LeChat's left sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove connector">
    1. Find "Civic Nexus" or the specific tool in your connectors list
    2. Click the **three dots** or **settings** icon next to the connector
    3. Select **"Remove"** or **"Disconnect"**
    4. Confirm the removal when prompted
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clean up authorizations (optional)">
    Visit [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com) to revoke service authorizations if you no longer want Civic to have access
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reset Connection

If your connector isn't working properly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete reset">
    1. Remove the Civic Nexus connector completely
    2. Refresh the LeChat page
    3. Follow the setup steps above to re-add with a fresh MCP URL from nexus.civic.com
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions
