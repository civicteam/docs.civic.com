```
"What MCP servers are available?"

"Help me set up GitHub integration"
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open VS Code Settings">
    Go to File â†’ Preferences â†’ Settings, then search for "MCP"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add MCP Server">
    Add a new MCP server with these settings:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Civic Nexus",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@civic/hub-bridge"]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable and Test">
    Enable the MCP features and test with: "What MCP servers are available?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="VS Code doesn't open when I click the install button">
Make sure VS Code is installed and try copying this URL manually:
```
vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22Civic%20Nexus%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40civic%2Fhub-bridge%22%5D%7D
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Node.js not found' error">
Install Node.js 18 or later from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and restart VS Code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP settings not found">
Make sure you have the MCP extension installed. Some VS Code versions require additional extensions for MCP support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication window doesn't open">
The Hub Bridge should handle authentication in the chat. If it doesn't:
1. Restart VS Code
2. Make sure you're trying to use a tool that requires authentication
3. Try running the Hub Bridge manually: `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge`
</Accordion>
