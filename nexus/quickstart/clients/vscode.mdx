    2. Search for "MCP"
    3. In the **MCP Servers** section, click **Add Server**
    4. Configure:
       - **Name**: Civic Nexus

### Option 2: Hub Bridge (Local Connection)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add to VS Code'">
    Use the one-click install button below:

    <a href="vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22Civic%20Nexus%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40civic%2Fhub-bridge%22%5D%7D">
      <div className="inline-block bg-[#007ACC] text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-[#005a9e] transition-colors">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install in VS Code">
    When VS Code opens, click "Install" to add the Civic Nexus MCP server
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable MCP Features">
    In VS Code Settings, search for "MCP" and enable the required MCP extension options
  </Step>

  <Step title="First-Time Authentication">
    The first time you use any MCP command, the Hub Bridge will:
    - Automatically download and install itself
    - Handle authentication directly in the chat interface
    - Let you select which tools to connect from nexus.civic.com
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Your Connection

Try these prompts in VS Code's chat/AI features:

```
"What MCP servers are available?"
"Show me my connected tools"
"Help me set up GitHub integration"
```

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If the one-click install doesn't work, add Civic Nexus manually:

### Method 1: Via VS Code Settings (Recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open VS Code Settings">
    Go to **File â†’ Preferences â†’ Settings**, then search for "MCP"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add MCP Server">
    1. Look for **MCP Servers** section in settings
    2. Click **Add Server** or **+**
    3. Configure the server:
       - **Name**: Civic Nexus
       - **Type**: stdio
       - **Command**: npx -y @civic/hub-bridge
    4. Save the configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable and Test">
    Enable MCP features and test with: "What MCP servers are available?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Via Configuration File  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create MCP Configuration File">
    Create a file called **`.mcp.json`** in your workspace root directory
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Configuration">
    Add the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "civic-nexus": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@civic/hub-bridge"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart VS Code">
    Save the file and restart VS Code. The MCP server will be automatically detected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Test with: "What MCP servers are available?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="VS Code doesn't open when I click the install button">
Make sure VS Code is installed and try copying this URL manually:
```
vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22Civic%20Nexus%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40civic%2Fhub-bridge%22%5D%7D
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Node.js not found' error">
Install Node.js 18 or later from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and restart VS Code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP settings not found">
Make sure you have the MCP extension installed. Some VS Code versions require additional extensions for MCP support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication window doesn't open">
The Hub Bridge should handle authentication in the chat. If it doesn't:
1. Restart VS Code
2. Make sure you're trying to use a tool that requires authentication
3. Try running the Hub Bridge manually: `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge`
</Accordion>

## Managing Your Tools

### Adding More Tools

You can add new tools directly in your VS Code chat:

```
"Connect me to GitHub"
"Add Slack to my available tools"  
"I need access to PostgreSQL"
"Show me what tools are available to connect"
```

VS Code will handle the connection process and guide you through any required authentication steps.

### Removing Tools

You can disconnect from specific tools directly in chat:

```
"Disconnect from Slack"  
"Remove GitHub from my tools"
"What tools do I currently have connected?"
"Stop my access to Dropbox"
