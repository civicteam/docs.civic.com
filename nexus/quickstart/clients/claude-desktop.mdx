"Check my GitHub repositories"  
"What's in my Dropbox?"
"Show recent Slack messages"
```

</Frame>

## Managing Your Tools

### Adding More Tools

You can add new tools directly in your Claude Desktop chat:

```
"Connect me to GitHub"
"Add Slack to my available tools"  
"I need access to Dropbox"
"Show me what tools are available to connect"
```

Claude will handle the connection process and guide you through any required authentication steps.

### Alternative Method: Hub Bridge (Free Users)

If you don't have Claude Pro, Team, or Enterprise, you won't have access to MCP connectors in the UI. Use Hub Bridge instead:

<Warning>
**Free Claude users**: The MCP connector UI is only available on paid Claude plans. Use this method if you're on the free plan.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open configuration file">
    1. In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings**
    2. Click the **Developer** tab  
    3. Click **Edit Config** to open `claude_desktop_config.json`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Hub Bridge configuration">
    Add this to your config file:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "civic-nexus": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@civic/hub-bridge@latest"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    <Note>
      This uses the **Hub Bridge** method which works with any Claude Desktop version, including free.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and restart">
    1. Save the config file
    2. **Restart Claude Desktop** for changes to take effect
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="First-time setup">
    When you first use an MCP command:
    1. Create account at **[nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com)** and select your tools
    2. The Hub Bridge will handle authentication automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Removing Tools

You can disconnect from specific tools directly in chat:

```
"Disconnect from Slack"  
"Remove GitHub from my tools"
"What tools do I currently have connected?"
"Stop my access to Dropbox"
```

### Managing the Entire Connector

To remove the Civic Nexus connector completely:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access connectors">
    Go to **Settings > Connectors** in Claude Desktop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove connector">
    1. Find "Civic Nexus" in your connectors list
    2. Click **Remove** or **Delete** next to the connector
    3. Confirm the removal when prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up (optional)">
    Visit [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com) to revoke service authorizations if you no longer want Civic to have access
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a paid Claude plan?">
    Yes, MCP connectors are currently only available on Claude Pro and Team plans. The free Claude plan doesn't support external integrations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if authentication fails?">
    If you encounter authentication issues:
    - Make sure you're logged into the correct account for the service
    - Check if your account email matches between nexus.civic.com and the service
    - Try removing and re-adding the MCP connector with a fresh URL
    - Check our [troubleshooting guide](/nexus/troubleshooting) for more solutions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use different email addresses?">
    If your nexus.civic.com account uses a different email than your connected services (e.g., work@company.com vs personal@gmail.com), make sure you authenticate with the correct account for each service during the OAuth flow.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My connector shows as disconnected">
    Try these steps:
    - Update Claude Desktop to the latest version
    - Remove the connector completely and re-add with a fresh MCP URL

    - Restart Claude Desktop after making changes
  </Accordion>
