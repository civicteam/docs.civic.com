      alt="Civic Nexus homepage"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse available MCP servers">
    Explore the directory of available MCP servers. Each server connects to a different service or tool.
    
    <Tip>
      Popular servers include Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, and Notion. Click on any server to see what it can do.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select servers to connect">
    Click the checkbox next to each MCP server you want to use. You can select multiple servers.
    
    <Warning>
      Some servers may require authentication with the service they connect to. Make sure you have access to accounts for the services you select.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your MCP URL">
    After selecting servers, you'll see your MCP URL. It will look like:
    ```
    https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp
    ```
    Click the copy button to copy this URL.
    
    <Warning>
      **Don't share this URL** - it's personalized to your account and gives access to your connected services.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Add Connector to Claude Desktop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Claude Desktop settings">
    In Claude Desktop:
    1. Click on your profile icon in the top right
    2. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu
    3. Navigate to the "Developer" section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add custom connector">
    1. Look for "MCP Connectors" or "Add connector" button
    2. Click "Add custom connector" 
    3. Enter a name: "Civic Nexus"
    4. Paste your MCP URL from nexus.civic.com
    5. Click "Add" then "Connect"
    
    <img
      className="rounded-lg"
      src="https://placehold.co/800x400/d1fae5/22c55e?text=Claude+Desktop+MCP+Settings"
      alt="Claude Desktop MCP connector settings"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Authenticate and Test

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete authentication">
    When you first use an MCP server that requires authentication:
    1. Claude will prompt you to connect to the service
    2. A browser window will open for OAuth authentication
    3. Sign in to the service and authorize access
    4. Return to Claude Desktop when complete
    
    <Note>
      Authentication is handled securely by Civic Nexus. Your credentials are never exposed to Claude or stored locally.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your connection">
    Try these simple commands to verify everything is working:
    
    ```
    "What MCP servers are available?"
    ```
    
    Or test a specific service:
    
    ```
    "Can you check my recent GitHub pull requests?"
    "What's in my Google Drive?"
    ```
    
    Claude should now be able to access and interact with your connected services.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your MCP Connectors

### Adding More Tools

You can add new tools directly in your Claude Desktop chat:

```
"Connect me to GitHub"
"Add Slack to my available tools"  
"I need access to PostgreSQL"
"Show me what tools are available to connect"
```

Claude will handle the connection process and guide you through any required authentication steps.

### Alternative Method: Direct Config File Editing

For advanced users, you can also manage MCP servers by editing the configuration file directly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open configuration file">
    1. In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings**
    2. Click the **Developer** tab  
    3. Click **Edit Config** to open `claude_desktop_config.json`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add or modify MCP servers">
    Your config file should look like this:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "civic-nexus": {
          "command": "curl",
          "args": ["-X", "POST", "https://nexus.civic.com/hub/mcp"],
          "env": {
            "CIVIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      **Use the UI method instead** - Manual config editing can break your setup if done incorrectly. The Settings UI is safer and easier.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and restart">
    1. Save the config file
    2. **Restart Claude Desktop** for changes to take effect
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Removing Tools

You can disconnect from specific tools directly in chat:

```
"Disconnect from Slack"  
"Remove GitHub from my tools"
"What tools do I currently have connected?"
"Stop my access to Google Drive"
```

### Removing the Entire Connector

To remove the Civic Nexus connector completely:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access connector settings">
    Go to **Settings → Developer → MCP Connectors** in Claude Desktop
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove connector">
    1. Find "Civic Nexus" in your connectors list
    2. Click the **Remove** or **Delete** button
    3. Confirm the removal when prompted
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean up authorizations (optional)">
    Visit [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com) to revoke service authorizations if you no longer want Civic to have access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Restart Claude Desktop to ensure the connector is fully removed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reset Connection

If your connector isn't working properly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete reset">
    1. Remove the Civic Nexus connector completely
    2. Restart Claude Desktop  
    3. Follow the setup steps above to re-add with a fresh MCP URL from nexus.civic.com
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a paid Claude plan?">
    Yes, MCP connectors are currently only available on Claude Pro and Team plans. The free Claude plan doesn't support external integrations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if authentication fails?">
    If you encounter authentication issues:
    - Make sure you're logged into the correct account for the service
    - Check if your account email matches between nexus.civic.com and the service
    - Try removing and re-adding the MCP connector with a fresh URL
    - Check our [troubleshooting guide](/nexus/troubleshooting) for more solutions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use different email addresses?">
    If your nexus.civic.com account uses a different email than your connected services (e.g., work@company.com vs personal@gmail.com), make sure you authenticate with the correct account for each service during the OAuth flow.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My connector shows as disconnected">
    Try these steps:
    - Update Claude Desktop to the latest version
    - Remove the connector completely and re-add with a fresh MCP URL
    - Check that your system allows Claude network access
    - Restart Claude Desktop after making changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
