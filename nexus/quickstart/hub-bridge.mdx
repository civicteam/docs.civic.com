## What is Hub Bridge?

Hub Bridge is a local proxy that connects clients (like Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains) to Civic Nexus. Your client thinks it's talking to a local MCP server, but the bridge handles authentication and forwards requests to your selected Nexus servers.

<Info>
**Use Hub Bridge when:** Your client only supports local/stdio MCP servers and doesn't have remote URL options.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
Make sure you have these before starting:
</Warning>

- **Node.js 18 or higher** - Check with `node --version`
- **Terminal access** - macOS/Linux Terminal, Windows PowerShell, or Command Prompt  
- **Internet connection** - For initial download and authentication
- **Default browser** - Bridge opens browser for one-time authentication

### Install Node.js (if needed)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    # Using Homebrew (recommended)
    brew install node
    
    # Or download from nodejs.org
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    # Using winget
    winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
    
    # Or download from nodejs.org
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm
    
    # Or use NodeSource repository for latest version
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Configure Your Client

Add a local MCP server to your client with these exact settings:

```json
{
  "name": "Civic Nexus",
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@civic/hub-bridge"]
}
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    Use the one-click install button, or add manually in Cursor Settings → Features → MCP
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="VS Code">
    Add to your MCP extension settings or use the direct install link
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JetBrains">
    Add to MCP plugin configuration in IDE settings
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other Clients">
    Look for "MCP Server," "Local MCP," or "stdio" configuration options
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: First Run Authentication

When you first use an MCP command, the bridge will automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download & Install">
    Bridge downloads itself (happens once, ~30 seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Browser">
    Your default browser opens to nexus.civic.com for authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Authenticate with your Civic account (Google, GitHub, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Servers">
    Choose which MCP servers you want to connect (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Apps">
    Complete OAuth flows for each selected service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready">
    Bridge is now configured and your client can access your tools
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Test Connection

Try these commands in your AI client:

```
"What MCP servers are available?"
"List my GitHub repositories"  
"Show me recent Slack messages"
```

## Managing Your Bridge

### Update Bridge
```bash
npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --update
```

The bridge also auto-updates when you run it, so you typically don't need to manually update.

### View Current Configuration
```bash
npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --status
```

### Reset/Reconfigure
```bash
npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --reset
```

This clears all settings and forces re-authentication.

### Uninstall

To completely remove Hub Bridge:

1. **Remove from your client:** Delete the MCP server configuration
2. **Clear cache:** `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --reset`  
3. **Optional:** Clear npm cache with `npm cache clean --force`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bridge command not found" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Problem:** `npx: command not found` or `'npx' is not recognized`
    
    **Solution:** 
    - Install Node.js 18+ from nodejs.org
    - Restart your terminal/IDE after installation
    - Verify with `node --version` and `npm --version`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Browser doesn't open for auth" icon="globe">
    **Problem:** Authentication browser window doesn't appear
    
    **Solution:**
    - Corporate firewall may be blocking - try from personal network
    - Manually visit the auth URL shown in terminal output
    - Check if default browser is set correctly
    - Try running from regular terminal instead of IDE terminal
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Client shows no tools/servers" icon="server">
    **Problem:** Bridge connects but client doesn't see any MCP tools
    
    **Solution:**
    - Restart your client completely after bridge setup
    - Check that you selected servers during authentication
    - Run `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --status` to verify configuration
    - Some clients need manual restart of MCP features
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication keeps failing" icon="key">
    **Problem:** Repeated auth prompts or 401 errors
    
    **Solution:**
    - Clear bridge cache: `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --reset`
    - Check system time is accurate (OAuth is time-sensitive)
    - Disable VPN temporarily during initial setup
    - Contact support if issue persists
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Slow or timing out" icon="clock">
    **Problem:** Bridge responses are slow or timeout
    
    **Solution:**
    - Check internet connection stability
    - Corporate proxy may be interfering - try personal network
    - Some MCP operations are inherently slower (large file operations)
    - Bridge caches auth tokens to minimize delays
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Corporate Network Considerations

If you're on a corporate network:

- **Proxy servers** may interfere with authentication - whitelist `nexus.civic.com` and `*.civic.com`
- **Firewall rules** might block npm/npx - work with IT to allow Node.js tools
- **Certificate issues** - corporate TLS inspection can cause SSL errors
- **Alternative:** Try initial setup from personal network, then bridge should work on corporate network

### Getting More Help

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Run `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge --status` and note any error messages
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Info">
    Note your OS, Node version (`node --version`), and client type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact Support">
    Include the above info when contacting support for faster resolution

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize bridge behavior with environment variables:

```bash
# Custom cache directory
export CIVIC_BRIDGE_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache

# Enable debug logging  
export CIVIC_BRIDGE_DEBUG=true

# Custom auth timeout (seconds)
export CIVIC_BRIDGE_AUTH_TIMEOUT=300
```

### Multiple Configurations

If you need different server sets for different projects, you can:

1. Use different cache directories with `CIVIC_BRIDGE_CACHE_DIR`
2. Or run `--reset` to reconfigure when switching contexts

### Performance Tips

- Bridge caches authentication tokens for 1 hour by default
- First request to each service may be slower due to token refresh
- Subsequent requests are much faster due to caching
- Bridge automatically handles token renewal in the background
