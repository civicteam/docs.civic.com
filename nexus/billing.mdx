## How Billing Works

Civic Nexus uses a simple **credit-based billing system**. Every action your AI assistant takes—from reading files to sending emails—uses credits. Think of credits like minutes on a phone plan: you get a monthly allowance that refreshes automatically.

### What Uses Credits?

- **Messages**: Conversations with your AI assistant
- **Tool calls**: When your AI uses connected tools (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- **Processing**: Reading and analyzing data

Your usage is measured in credits, which are automatically deducted as you use the platform. You can always see your remaining balance in your account dashboard.

## Understanding Credits

### How Many Credits Do I Need?

Here are some real-world examples based on actual usage to help you estimate:

**Typical Usage Examples:**
- **Basic conversation** (simple Q&A, no tools): ~20-50 credits
- **Checking your calendar** (installing tool + retrieving events): ~150 credits
- **Writing and reviewing code** (reading files, making suggestions): ~100-300 credits
- **GitHub pull request review** (fetching PR, analyzing changes): ~200-400 credits
- **Document search and summary** (searching multiple docs, synthesizing): ~300-500 credits
- **Complex multi-step task** (multiple tools, several API calls): ~500-1,000 credits

**What can 100,000 credits do?**
- **200-650 substantial tasks** like calendar checks, code reviews, or document searches
- **2,000-5,000 simple conversations** for basic Q&A without tools
- **Daily professional use** with a healthy mix of simple and complex interactions throughout the month
- Plenty of room for experimentation and exploration

### Running Low on Credits?

**When you run out of credits mid-month, you can:**
1. **Purchase a credit top-up** - Add 25,000 credits for $5 (available on Standard Plan)
2. **Wait for monthly reset** - Your credits automatically refill on the 1st of each month
3. **Upgrade your plan** - Switch to a higher tier for more credits

## Managing Your Subscription

### How to Upgrade

**From your trial or free account:**

1. Log in to [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com)
2. Click **"Billing"** in your account menu
3. Select **"Upgrade to Standard Plan"**
4. Complete the secure checkout process with Stripe
5. Start using your credits immediately

### Purchasing Credit Top-Ups

**Need more credits before your monthly reset?**

1. Go to your **Billing** page
2. Click **"Purchase Additional Credits"**
3. Buy a credit pack: **25,000 credits for $5**
4. Credits are added to your account immediately
5. Use them anytime during your current billing period

<Note>Top-up credits don't roll over to the next month—they're a one-time boost for your current period.</Note>

### Monthly Credit Reset

**Your credits automatically refresh every month:**

- **Reset date**: The 1st day of each calendar month
- **What resets**: Your credit balance returns to your plan's full amount
- **Usage tracking**: Previous month's usage is saved in your account history
- **No rollover**: Unused credits don't carry forward (similar to mobile phone plans)

**Example:**
If you're on the Standard Plan and use 60,000 credits in January, you'll still get a fresh 100,000 credits on February 1st.
