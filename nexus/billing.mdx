## Consuming Credits

You can consume credits in two ways. Both draw from the same credit balance.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Nexus Chat" icon="comments">
    Workflows executed interactively in the Nexus interface. Includes full reasoning and orchestration cost.

    **Best for:**
    - Prototyping workflows quickly
    - Testing tools and integrations interactively
    - Iterating on multi-step logic without writing code
  </Card>

  <Card title="Your Own Tooling" icon="code">
    Workflows triggered from your chatbot, IDE, or SDK. Credits measure only Nexus orchestration—not your LLM costs.

    **Best for:**
    - Embedding Nexus inside your application
    - Automating workflows programmatically
    - Controlling prompts, data access, or orchestration directly
  </Card>

## What's Included in a Credit?

Credits measure end-to-end execution cost of a Nexus workflow:

- LLM compute for reasoning, planning, and content generation
- Any tools or APIs you call (Slack, HubSpot, GitHub, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Data handling, chaining steps, routing inputs/outputs
- Any SDK-driven or IDE-driven execution that routes through Nexus

### Typical Usage Examples

| Task | Credits |
|------|---------|
| Basic conversation (simple Q&A, no tools) | ~20-50 |
| Checking your calendar | ~150 |
| Writing and reviewing code | ~100-300 |
| GitHub pull request review | ~200-400 |
| Document search and summary | ~300-500 |
| Complex multi-step task | ~500-1,000 |

**What can 100,000 credits do?**
- 200-650 substantial tasks like calendar checks, code reviews, or document searches
- 2,000-5,000 simple conversations for basic Q&A without tools
- Daily professional use with a healthy mix of interactions throughout the month

## Troubleshooting Payment Issues

### Payment Method Failed

If your Nexus payment fails, the system will automatically retry the charge. Your account may be temporarily paused but will be reactivated as soon as a payment succeeds. If your payment continues to fail, it may be a result of one of the reasons below:

**Common reasons for payment failure:**

* Expired credit/debit card
* Insufficient funds
* Card issuer decline (fraud prevention)
* Incorrect billing information
* Processing errors

Before contacting support, try these troubleshooting steps:

**Steps to resolve:**

1. Go to **Billing** in your account menu
2. Click **"Manage Billing"** to access the Stripe portal
3. Check that your payment method details are current and accurate
4. Ensure your card has sufficient funds and isn't expired
5. Try updating to a different payment method if available
6. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again
