## What are Authorizations?

An authorization is the permission you give Civic Nexus to access your tools and services on your behalf. When you connect a service like GitHub, Slack, or Notion to Nexus, you're creating an authorization that allows your AI assistants to interact with that service using your account.

<Note>
**You're always in control** - Once you've given access to your tools, you can always revoke them instantly. Authorizations are not permanent and can be managed at any time.
</Note>

## How Authorizations Work

When you first connect a service to Nexus:

1. **You grant permission** - You authorize Nexus to access specific data from the service
2. **Secure token storage** - Nexus securely stores your access tokens with encryption
3. **AI assistant access** - Your AI can now use that service through MCP tools
4. **Ongoing control** - You maintain full control to revoke access anytime

## Managing Your Authorizations

### Full Control Over Access

- ‚úÖ **View all connections** - See every service you've authorized
- ‚úÖ **Instant revocation** - Remove access to any service immediately  
- ‚úÖ **Immediate effect** - Changes apply across all your AI assistants instantly

### When to Revoke Access

You might want to revoke authorizations when:

- **No longer using a service** - Clean up unused connections
- **Security concerns** - Remove access if you suspect any issues
- **Account changes** - When switching accounts or roles
- **Testing purposes** - Temporarily disable specific integrations
- **Privacy preferences** - Limit AI assistant access to certain data

## How to Revoke Authorizations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Your Dashboard">
    Go to [nexus.civic.com](https://nexus.civic.com) and sign in to your account
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Authorization Settings">
    Navigate to your account settings or connected services section
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Service to Revoke">
    Find the service you want to disconnect and click the revoke or disconnect option
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Revocation">
    Confirm that you want to remove access to this service
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Immediate Effect**: When you revoke access to a service, it will immediately stop working across all your AI assistants. Any ongoing conversations or tasks using that service will be interrupted.
</Warning>

## Authorization Scope and Permissions

### What You Authorize

When you connect a service, you typically grant access to:

- **Read your data** - View files, messages, repositories, etc.
- **Create content** - Add new items, send messages, create files
- **Update existing items** - Edit documents, update records, modify settings
- **Delete items** - Remove content when explicitly requested

### What You DON'T Authorize

Nexus and your AI assistants cannot:

- **Access other accounts** - Only your explicitly connected accounts
- **Exceed your permissions** - AI has the same limits as your user account
- **Access unrelated services** - Only services you've specifically connected
- **Persist beyond revocation** - Access stops immediately when revoked

## Security and Privacy

### Protected Information

Your authorization data is protected through:

- üîí **Encrypted storage** - All tokens encrypted at rest
- üîê **Secure transmission** - TLS encryption for all communications  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Access controls** - Only you can view or modify your authorizations
- ‚è∞ **Automatic refresh** - Tokens refreshed securely without your intervention

### Minimal Permissions

When you connect a service to Nexus, we only ask for the specific permissions we actually need. We request the minimum access required for AI assistants to work with your tools, and nothing more.

This approach helps protect your data by ensuring Nexus never requests unnecessary permissions to access or modify your accounts.
