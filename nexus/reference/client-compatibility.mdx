## Compatibility Overview

Nexus works with all major AI assistants and development tools. The setup method depends on whether your client supports remote MCP URLs.

<Note>
**Quick rule**: If your client settings mention "remote MCP URL" or "HTTP connector", use **Direct URL**. If they only show "local MCP server" or "stdio/command", use **Hub Bridge**.
</Note>

## Connection Methods

### Direct URL (Simpler)

**How it works:** Copy the MCP URL from nexus.civic.com and paste it into your client's settings.

**Clients that support this:**
- Claude Desktop
- Claude.ai (Web)
- Goose
- Any client with "remote MCP URL" or "HTTP connector" options

**Pros:**
- âœ… Fastest setup (2 minutes)
- âœ… No local software needed
- âœ… Automatic updates
- âœ… Works across devices

**Setup steps:**
1. Visit nexus.civic.com and select tools
2. Copy your MCP URL 
3. Paste into client settings

### Hub Bridge (Universal Compatibility)

**How it works:** Install a local bridge that connects your client to Nexus servers.

**Clients that need this:**
- Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs
- Windsurf, Claude Code, Gemini CLI
- Any client with only "local MCP server" options

**Pros:**
- âœ… Works with any MCP client
- âœ… Local configuration control
- âœ… Works offline after setup

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Terminal/command line access

**Setup steps:**
1. Configure client to run `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge`
2. First run opens browser for authentication
3. Select tools during setup process

## Which Method Should I Use?

### Try Direct URL First
If your client supports it, Direct URL is almost always better:
- Faster setup
- No Node.js requirement
- No local software to maintain
- Works immediately across devices

### When to Use Hub Bridge
Use Hub Bridge if:
- Your client doesn't have "remote MCP URL" options
- You're using development tools like IDEs
- You prefer local control over connections
- You need offline functionality

## Common Setup Scenarios

### First-Time Users
**Recommendation:** Start with Claude Desktop (Direct URL)
- Easiest setup process
- Most reliable connection
- Best documentation and support
- Great for learning how MCP works

### Developers
**Popular choices:**
- **VS Code + Hub Bridge**: Best for coding workflows
- **Cursor + Hub Bridge**: AI-first development experience
- **Claude Desktop**: For quick queries and automation

### Teams
**Consider:**
- **Claude.ai (Web)**: No installation required, works anywhere
- **Claude Desktop**: Consistent experience across team members
- **Multiple clients**: Different team members can use different clients with the same Nexus setup

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Remote MCP URL not supported"
Your client needs Hub Bridge. Follow the Hub Bridge setup guide for your specific client.

### "Node.js not found" 
Hub Bridge requires Node.js 18+. Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or use a package manager.

### Connection timeout errors
- **Direct URL**: Check internet connection and firewall settings
- **Hub Bridge**: Ensure Node.js is properly installed and try restarting

### Authentication failures
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Use incognito/private mode for OAuth
- Check if your organization blocks OAuth flows
