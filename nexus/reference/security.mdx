## Common Security Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I revoke access to my apps?" icon="shield">
    Yes! You can revoke authorization for any connected app at any time through your Civic Nexus dashboard. Changes take effect immediately and will disconnect that service from all your AI assistants.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my tokens stored?" icon="lock">
    Your access tokens are encrypted and stored in secure, enterprise-grade infrastructure. They're never exposed to AI clients, other users, or external systems beyond the authorized app connections you've approved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when tokens expire?" icon="clock">
    Civic Nexus automatically handles token refresh for all your connected services. You'll never need to manually re-authenticate or deal with expired tokens - it all happens seamlessly in the background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can AI assistants see my sensitive data?" icon="eye">
    AI assistants can only access data from apps you've explicitly connected and authorized. The access follows the same permissions you have in those apps - no more, no less. You control which apps to connect and can disconnect them anytime.
  </Accordion>

    Yes, all data transmission between your AI assistants, Civic Nexus, and your connected apps uses enterprise-grade TLS encryption. Your data is protected at every step of the workflow.
