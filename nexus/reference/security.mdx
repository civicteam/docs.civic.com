## Common Security Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Where are my tokens stored?" icon="lock">
    Your access tokens are encrypted and stored in secure, stringent infrastructure. They're never exposed to AI clients, other users, or external systems beyond the authorized app connections you've approved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when tokens expire?" icon="clock">
    Civic Nexus automatically handles token refresh for all your connected services. You'll never need to manually re-authenticate or deal with expired tokens - it all happens seamlessly in the background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can AI assistants see my sensitive data?" icon="eye">
    AI assistants can only access data from apps you've explicitly connected and authorized. The access follows the same permissions you have in those apps - no more, no less. You control which apps to connect and can disconnect them anytime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data encrypted in transit?" icon="shield-check">
    Yes, all data transmission between your AI assistants, Civic Nexus, and your connected apps uses stringent TLS encryption. Your data is protected at every step of the workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you ensure MCP servers are secure?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    We actively review and manage all MCP servers in our directory. Every server undergoes security review before being added, and we continuously monitor for vulnerabilities. Updates are only deployed after thorough security assessment to ensure your data remains protected.
