## Best Practices

### Issue Management Workflow
1. **Team Discovery**: Use `list_teams` to understand workspace structure
2. **Issue Creation**: Use `create_issue` with appropriate team, priority, and labels
3. **Progress Tracking**: Use `search_issues` with state filters to monitor progress
4. **Status Updates**: Use `update_issue` to move issues through workflow states
5. **Communication**: Use `add_comment` for updates and collaboration

### Project Planning Best Practices
1. **Project Setup**: Use `create_project` with clear timelines and team assignments
2. **Sprint Organization**: Use `list_cycles` to plan work in iterations
3. **Workload Distribution**: Balance assignments using `list_users` and search filters
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track project completion with filtered issue searches

### Workflow Optimization
1. **State Management**: Use `list_workflows` to understand available transitions
2. **Label Strategy**: Use `list_labels` to maintain consistent categorization
3. **Automation**: Create issues automatically based on errors, deployments, or events
4. **Integration**: Link issues to code commits, pull requests, and deployments

### Team Coordination
1. **Assignment Strategy**: Assign issues based on expertise and current workload
2. **Priority Management**: Use priority levels consistently across teams
3. **Communication**: Keep issue comments updated with progress and blockers
4. **Cross-team Dependencies**: Use projects to coordinate work between teams

<Warning>
Always verify team IDs, user IDs, and state IDs using the list tools before creating or updating issues.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Use descriptive issue titles and markdown-formatted descriptions for better searchability and team communication.
