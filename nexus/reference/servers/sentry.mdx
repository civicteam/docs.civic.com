  <Step title="Connect to Sentry">
    Add the Sentry server to your Nexus environment through the server directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Sentry">
    Connect your Sentry account using OAuth to access your organizations and projects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Start with `whoami` to verify authentication and `find organizations` to see your available data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Requirements

### Authentication Setup
The Sentry server uses OAuth2 authentication with Sentry's API:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Flow" icon="shield-check">
    1. **OAuth Authorization**: Authenticate via Sentry's OAuth flow
    2. **Organization Access**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions in target organizations
    3. **API Permissions**: Verify your account has API access enabled
    4. **Regional URLs**: Some operations may require region-specific URLs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Required Permissions" icon="key">
    - **Read Access**: View issues, events, traces, and project data
    - **Write Access**: Update issues, create teams (if using management tools)
    - **Organization Access**: Access to organizations you want to monitor
    - **Project Access**: View and manage specific projects
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Server Configuration
- **Transport**: HTTP-based remote server
- **Endpoint**: `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp`
- **Region Support**: Supports both SaaS (sentry.io) and self-hosted installations
- **API Version**: Compatible with Sentry's REST API

<Note>
The Sentry server is hosted remotely and connects directly to Sentry's API infrastructure for optimal performance and security.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Error Investigation Workflow
1. **Start with Search**: Use `search_events` with natural language queries to find relevant errors
2. **Get Issue Details**: Use `get_issue_details` for specific issues that need investigation
3. **Analyze Context**: Review stacktraces, user context, and related events
4. **Track Resolution**: Use `update_issue` to assign, resolve, or prioritize issues

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Trace Analysis**: Use `get_trace_details` for specific slow requests or transactions
2. **Pattern Detection**: Use `search_events` for performance aggregations and trends
3. **Release Comparison**: Compare performance across releases using `find_releases`
4. **Bottleneck Identification**: Focus on spans with high duration or error rates

### Team Collaboration
1. **Organization Setup**: Use `find_organizations` and `find_teams` to understand structure
2. **Project Discovery**: Use `find_projects` to map applications and ownership
3. **Issue Assignment**: Use `update_issue` with team assignments for collaborative resolution
4. **Status Tracking**: Maintain clear issue status to track resolution progress

<Warning>
Always verify organization and project slugs using the discovery tools before performing operations on specific resources.
</Warning>
