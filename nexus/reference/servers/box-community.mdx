## Overview

The Box Community Edition server provides full file management capabilities for your Box account. Unlike the [official Box server](/nexus/reference/servers/box) (read-only + AI), this community-maintained server enables AI assistants to upload, delete, move, copy files, manage shared links, and view collaborations.

<Note>
**When to use which server:**
- **Box (Official)**: Read files, search, and use Box AI for document Q&A and metadata extraction
- **Box Community Edition**: Full file/folder management with create, update, and delete operations
</Note>

## Security Guardrails

The Box Community Edition server has built-in security constraints to prevent accidental or malicious operations:

<Warning>
**Default Security Restrictions:**
- Public shared links ('open' access) are blocked - use 'company' or 'collaborators' instead
- Recursive folder deletion is disabled to prevent accidental data loss
- Uploading to the root folder is blocked - specify a parent folder
- Malicious file types (.exe, .dll, .bat, etc.) cannot be uploaded or downloaded
</Warning>

## Known Limitations

- **Root folder ID**: Use `"0"` to reference the root folder
- **Folder IDs required**: Most operations require folder/file IDs - use search tools to find them first
- **Box AI subscription**: AI features require Box AI to be enabled on your account
- **Enterprise features**: Some features like user listing may require Box Enterprise

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Use search tools first to find file and folder IDs, then use those IDs for management operations.
