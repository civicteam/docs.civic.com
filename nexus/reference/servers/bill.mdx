# Bill.com Server

## Overview

The Bill.com server provides comprehensive integration with [Bill.com](https://bill.com) accounting and payment services. This server enables AI assistants to manage vendors, bills, payments, customers, invoices, and complete AP/AR workflows programmatically.

## Access Types

Bill.com supports two authentication methods, each with different capabilities:

| Access Type | Capabilities | Best For |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Sync Token** (Limited) | Read data, create/update records, sync operations | ERP syncing, reporting, read-only integrations |
| **Full Access** (Complete) | All operations including payments, invoicing, user management | Complete AP/AR operations, payment processing |

<Note>
Both access types use the same credential fields in Nexus (Developer Key, Username, Password, Organization ID). The difference is what credentials you provide - see the setup sections below.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    **Problem**: "Invalid credentials" or "Authentication failed"

    **Solutions for Sync Token**:
    - Verify your Developer Key is correct
    - Ensure the Sync Token name and value match exactly
    - Confirm the Organization ID starts with `008`
    - Check that you're using sandbox credentials for the sandbox environment

    **Solutions for Full Access**:
    - Verify your Bill.com email and password are correct
    - Ensure your Developer Key matches the environment (sandbox vs production)
    - Confirm your Bill.com user account has API access enabled
    - Check if MFA is enabled on your account (may block API access)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developer Key Invalid (BDC_1102)">
    **Problem**: "Developer key is invalid" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Developer keys are environment-specific - sandbox keys only work with sandbox, production keys only work with production
    - Verify you're using the correct environment setting
    - Try regenerating your Developer Key in Bill.com settings
    - Check if your API access subscription is active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Permissions / Operation Not Available">
    **Problem**: "Access denied", "Insufficient permissions", or operation fails

    **Solutions**:
    - Some operations require **Full Access** credentials (not Sync Token)
    - Operations requiring Full Access include: payments, voiding, sending invoices, charging customers, user management
    - If using Sync Token and need these features, switch to Full Access credentials
    - Verify your Bill.com user account has the required permissions
