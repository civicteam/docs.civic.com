# Bill.com Server

## Overview

The Bill.com server provides comprehensive integration with [Bill.com](https://bill.com) accounting and payment services. This server enables AI assistants to manage vendors, bills, payments, customers, invoices, and complete AP/AR workflows programmatically.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Bill.com">
    Add the Bill.com server to your Nexus environment through the server directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain Bill.com Credentials">
    Get your AP/AR Sync Token and Developer Key from the Bill.com sandbox portal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Start with `list_vendors` or `list_bank_accounts` to verify the connection works properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Setup

Bill.com uses **session-based authentication** with AP/AR Sync Tokens. Follow these steps to get your credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Bill.com">
    Sign in to your Bill.com account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Developer Key">
    1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Sync & Integrations** → **Manage Developer Keys**
    2. Click **Add Developer Key** to generate a new key (you can have up to 4)
    3. Copy the generated **Developer Key**
    4. Save this as your `BILL_DEV_KEY`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create AP/AR Sync Token">
    1. From the same **Sync & Integrations** page, go to the **Tokens** section
    2. Click **Create AP/AR Sync Token**
    3. Enter a descriptive name for your token (e.g., `nexus-integration`)
       - This name becomes your `BILL_USERNAME`
    4. Click **Create** and immediately copy the generated token value
       - This value is your `BILL_PASSWORD`
       - **Important**: Save this token immediately as it won't be shown again
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Organization ID">
    1. Your Organization ID is displayed on the **Sync & Integrations** page
    2. It starts with `008`
    3. Save this as your `BILL_ORGANIZATION_ID`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Credentials in Nexus">
    When adding the Bill.com server in Nexus, you'll be prompted for:
    - **Developer Key**: Your `BILL_DEV_KEY` from Step 2
    - **Token Name**: Your `BILL_USERNAME` from Step 3
    - **Token Value**: Your `BILL_PASSWORD` from Step 3

## Session Management

The Bill.com server automatically manages authentication sessions:

- **Session Duration**: 48 hours
- **Auto-Refresh**: Sessions refresh automatically 5 minutes before expiration
- **Re-authentication**: If a session expires, the server automatically logs in again

You don't need to manage sessions manually - the server handles all authentication transparently.
