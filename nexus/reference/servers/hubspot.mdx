## Configuration Requirements

### Authentication Setup
The HubSpot server uses OAuth2 authentication with HubSpot's API:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth Scopes" icon="key">
    **Required Scopes for Full Functionality:**
    - **CRM Objects**: Read/write access to contacts, companies, deals, tickets
    - **Properties**: Manage custom properties and object schemas
    - **Associations**: Create and manage object relationships
    - **Engagements**: Create and manage notes, tasks, and activities
    - **Workflows**: Read access to automation workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account Requirements" icon="building">
    - **HubSpot Account**: Free or paid HubSpot account with CRM access
    - **API Access**: Ensure API access is enabled for your account tier
    - **Permissions**: Admin or appropriate role permissions for the operations you need
    - **Rate Limits**: Be aware of HubSpot's API rate limits based on your account tier
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Server Configuration
- **Transport**: STDIO-hosted (local Hub Bridge required)
- **Hub Bridge**: Uses `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge` for authentication and requests
- **API Integration**: Direct connection to HubSpot's REST API
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic rate limit handling with retry logic

<Note>
The HubSpot server requires Hub Bridge for authentication management and API request handling.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### CRM Data Management
1. **Object Strategy**: Use `hubspot-list-objects` to understand your current data structure
2. **Search Optimization**: Use `hubspot-search-objects` for complex queries instead of filtering large lists
3. **Batch Operations**: Use batch tools for bulk operations to improve performance and avoid rate limits
4. **Property Planning**: Use `hubspot-list-properties` before creating custom fields

### Association Management
1. **Relationship Discovery**: Use `hubspot-get-association-definitions` to understand available relationships
2. **Systematic Linking**: Create associations systematically (contact → company → deal)
3. **Association Cleanup**: Regularly audit and clean up unnecessary associations
4. **Performance Impact**: Consider association queries impact on API performance

### Workflow Integration
1. **Automation Audit**: Use `hubspot-list-workflows` to understand existing automations
2. **Engagement Logging**: Create engagements to maintain comprehensive customer interaction history
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensure data quality with property validation and required fields
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor API usage to stay within rate limits

### Sales Process Optimization
1. **Deal Pipeline**: Structure deals with consistent stages and properties
2. **Activity Tracking**: Log all customer interactions as engagements
3. **Custom Properties**: Create custom fields for business-specific requirements
4. **Reporting Data**: Structure data to support reporting and analytics needs

<Warning>
HubSpot has strict rate limits that vary by account tier. Use batch operations when possible and implement proper error handling for rate limit responses.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Start with read operations to understand your data structure before implementing create/update operations. Use the HubSpot UI to verify API changes during development.
</Tip>
