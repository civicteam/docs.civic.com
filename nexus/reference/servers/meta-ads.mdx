## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues After Connecting

Meta's OAuth flow sometimes does not prompt for ads permissions during authorization. If you've connected successfully but still receive permission errors, you'll need to grant ad account access manually.

<Warning>
This is a known issue with Meta's OAuth — the ad account must explicitly grant your user account the proper permissions, which can't always be done through the OAuth flow alone.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Grant permissions via Business Manager (Recommended)">
    1. Go to [Meta Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings)
    2. Navigate to **Users** > **People** in the left sidebar
    3. Find yourself in the list and click your name
    4. Click **Assign Assets**
    5. Select the **Ad Accounts** tab
    6. Find your ad account and select it
    7. Make sure you have **Manage campaigns** or **Full control** permission selected
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 2: Direct Ad Account Access">
    1. Go to [Meta Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com)
    2. In the account selector, find your ad account
    3. Click the account settings
    4. Go to **Ad Account Roles**
    5. Make sure your account has **Admin** or **Advertiser** role
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

After making these changes in Business Manager, the permissions should propagate and you can reconnect the server.
