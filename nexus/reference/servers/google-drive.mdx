**Search Operators:** Supports Google Drive query syntax including `name contains 'text'`, `mimeType = 'application/pdf'`, `modifiedTime > '2024-01-01'`.

**File Types:** Native Google files (Docs, Sheets, Slides) export as text/CSV. Office files are parsed to extract readable text. Binary files attempt UTF-8 decode.

**Shared Drives:** Use `drive_id` parameter to specify shared drives. Set `include_items_from_all_drives: true` to search across all accessible drives.
