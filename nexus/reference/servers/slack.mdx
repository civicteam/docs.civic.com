## Overview

The Slack server enables AI assistants to interact with your [Slack](https://slack.com) workspaces, allowing seamless communication, channel management, and team collaboration through conversational AI.

## How to Add Slack

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Slack App">
    1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
    2. Click **Create New App**
    3. Select **From scratch**
    4. Name your app and select your workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth Permissions">
    1. In your app settings, click **OAuth & Permissions** in the left menu
    2. Under **Scopes > Bot Token Scopes**, add the required access permissions

    <Info>
    **Required OAuth Scopes**

    For the test commands below to work, add these minimum Bot Token Scopes:
    - `channels:read` - List and view basic channel information
    - `channels:history` - Read message history from public channels

    Depending on your use case, you may also want to add:
    - `chat:write` - Post messages to channels
    - `users:read` - View basic user information  
    - `reactions:read` - View emoji reactions
    - `reactions:write` - Add emoji reactions to messages
    - `files:read` - Access file content

    You can always add more scopes later by returning to the **OAuth & Permissions** page in your Slack app settings.
    </Info>

    3. Scroll up and click **Install to [workspace]**
    4. Invite the bot to the requisite channels:
       - Open the Slack channel where you want the bot to work
       - Click on the channel name at the top to open channel details
       - Go to the **Integrations** tab
       - Click **Add apps** and select your bot
       - Alternatively, you can type `/invite @YourBotName` in any channel to add it
    5. Restart Slack to ensure the changes take effect
    6. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** that appears in the **OAuth & Permissions** section in the left menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Nexus">
    1. Add the Slack server to your Nexus environment through the server directory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    1. Start with a simple command like `list channels` or `get recent messages from #general` to verify the connection works properly.
    2. You will be prompted to authorize the connection with Slack using the bot token that you copied from step 2.6.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you have difficulty prompting the bot to update OAuth token, go to **Nexus > Org & Toolkit > Account**, delete Slack, then re-add the Slack server to get the prompt again.
