## Overview

The Atlassian server enables AI assistants to interact with [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), providing comprehensive project management and documentation capabilities through Rovo-powered intelligent search and full read/write access.

## Use Cases

### Sprint Planning
"Search Jira for all tasks in project AUTH with status 'Backlog' created in the last 2 weeks. Show me the top 10, then transition them to 'Selected for Development' and add a comment 'Added to Sprint 23'"

### Team Standup Preparation
"Show me all Jira issues assigned to me that are 'In Progress'. For each issue, get the latest comments and summarize my current status. Also show which issues are due this week."

### Documentation Sync
"Search for all bugs in project AUTH tagged 'api-endpoint' that were resolved this sprint. Create a Confluence page in the Labs space titled 'Sprint 23 - API Endpoints Completed' with a summary of each bug and its resolution."

### Research Workflow
"Search for 'authentication analytics' across Jira and Confluence, summarize the top 5 results, then create a new Confluence page in the Labs space titled 'Authentication Analytics Research Summary' with your findings"

<Note>
**Available Products:** Both Confluence and Jira with full read/write capabilities

**Search Tip:** Use Rovo Search (atlassian-search) by default for intelligent cross-product search. Only use CQL/JQL when you need precise field-level filtering.

**URL Handling:** Most tools accept full Confluence/Jira URLs and will extract IDs automatically.

**Content Format:** All page and comment creation uses Markdown format.
</Note>

<Warning>
The MCP server currently requests over-privileged access, so you cannot limit it to read-only operations. Coupled with the lack of approval requests in Nexus, care must be taken when using this MCP server.
</Warning>
