## Overview

The SharePoint server enables AI assistants to interact with [Microsoft SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration), providing comprehensive site management, document handling, list creation, and content publishing capabilities through Microsoft Graph API.

## How to Add SharePoint

<Warning>
**Personal Outlook Users:** SharePoint is not available for free outlook.com email addresses. You must have a Microsoft 365 Business license or Azure Cloud tenant to use this integration.
</Warning>

### Microsoft 365 Business Users

For Microsoft 365 Business or Office 365 license holders, **admin approval is required** for first-time setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Authorization Attempt">
    Add the SharePoint server and attempt to authorize. Non-admin users will see a "Need admin approval" dialog indicating that Civic Nexus needs permission to access resources in your organization that only an admin can grant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admin Grants Consent (One-Time)">
    Your Microsoft tenant administrator must configure consent in Microsoft Entra ID:

    **Access Entra ID:**
    - From Microsoft 365: Click the app launcher (grid icon) in the top-left corner of any Microsoft 365 app → Click **Admin** → From the left sidebar, click **Show All** → Under "Admin centers", select **Identity**
    - From Azure Portal: Click the app launcher (grid icon) in the top-left corner → Select **Entra** from the Microsoft Cloud services

    **Configure User Consent:**
    1. In Entra ID, select **Enterprise apps** from the left sidebar
    2. Under the "Security" section, click **Consent and permissions**
    3. Click **User consent settings**
    4. Select "Allow user consent for apps from verified publishers, for selected permissions" (This allows users to trigger authorization requests from Nexus, since Civic is a verified publisher)
    5. Click **Save** (Important: Save before proceeding to the next step)
    6. Click "Select permissions to classify as low impact" (This whitelists the specific permissions users are allowed to consent to. If prompted to save, click **Save** before moving on)
    7. On the permissions screen, click **Add permissions** → Select **Microsoft Graph**
    8. Select all **OpenId permissions** (required): `openid`, `profile`, `email`
    9. Add the base permissions: `offline_access`, `User.Read`
    10. Add SharePoint permissions based on your organization's needs:
        - **Read-only access**: `Sites.Read.All`, `Files.Read.All`, `Lists.Read.All`
        - **Read/Write access**: `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `Lists.ReadWrite.All`
        - **Advanced management** (optional): `Sites.Manage.All`, `Sites.FullControl.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All`
    11. Click **Add permissions** then **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait and Retry">
    Wait up to **1 hour** for changes to propagate, then retry authorization in Nexus.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Authorization">
    You'll now see a standard OAuth consent screen showing "Permissions requested" by Civic Nexus. The app will request permissions such as:
    - Maintain access to data you have given it access to
    - Read items in all site collections
    - View your basic profile

    Click **Accept** to complete the authorization and start using the SharePoint integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Alternative Setup Method:** The steps above use a proactive approach where admins configure permissions up-front. Alternatively, administrators can enable "Admin consent requests" (found in **Admin consent settings** within Entra ID). This allows users to trigger approval requests directly when they attempt to authorize, and admins can approve on-demand rather than pre-configuring permissions.
