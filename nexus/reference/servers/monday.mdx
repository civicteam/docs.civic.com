    **Required Scopes for Full Functionality:**
    - **Boards**: Read/write access to boards, items, groups, columns
    - **Users**: Read access to users and teams
    - **Workspaces**: Manage workspaces, folders, and organization

    - **Permissions**: Appropriate role permissions for creating and managing resources
    - **Rate Limits**: Be aware of API rate limits based on your account tier
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Board & Item Management
1. **Schema First**: Always use `get_board_info` before querying items to understand column structure
2. **Performance Optimization**: Set `includeColumns: false` when you only need item counts or IDs
3. **Filtering**: Use column-specific filters after understanding board schema from get_board_info
4. **Pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets

### Form Building
1. **Structure Planning**: Design form flow and question types before creation
2. **Schema Validation**: Use form_questions_editor with appropriate question types and settings
3. **User Experience**: Configure appearance, accessibility, and submission behavior
4. **Response Management**: Set up board groups and notifications during form creation

### Document Management
1. **Location Strategy**: Decide between workspace docs (standalone) vs item docs (contextual)
2. **Markdown Format**: Use proper markdown formatting for rich document content
3. **Organization**: Use folders and workspaces for logical document grouping
4. **Pagination**: Handle pagination for large document collections

### Dashboard & Analytics
1. **Schema First**: Always call `all_widgets_schema` before creating widgets
2. **Board Selection**: Choose relevant boards that contain the data to visualize
3. **Widget Configuration**: Validate settings against schema to prevent creation failures
4. **Dashboard Organization**: Use folders to organize dashboards by purpose or team

### GraphQL Operations
1. **Schema Exploration**: Use `get_graphql_schema` and `get_type_details` before custom queries
2. **Field Selection**: Request only needed fields to minimize data transfer
3. **Column Planning**: Use `get_column_type_info` before creating columns
4. **Testing**: Test queries with read operations before write operations

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Start with read operations (`get_board_info`, `list_workspaces`, `workspace_info`) to understand your environment structure before implementing create/update operations.
</Tip>
