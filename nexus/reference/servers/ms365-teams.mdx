## Overview

The Microsoft 365 Teams server enables AI assistants to interact with [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), providing channel messaging, team discovery, and cross-service workflow capabilities through Microsoft Graph API.

## How to Add Microsoft 365 Teams

The setup process varies depending on your Microsoft account type:

<Warning>
**Free Teams Users:** The Microsoft Teams MCP server API is incompatible with the free Teams app. You must have a Microsoft 365 Business license or Azure Cloud tenant to use this integration.
</Warning>

### Microsoft 365 Business Users

For Microsoft 365 Business or Office 365 license holders, **admin approval is required** for first-time setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Authorization Attempt">
    Add the Microsoft 365 Teams server and attempt to authorize. Non-admin users will see a "Need admin approval" dialog indicating that Civic Nexus needs permission to access resources in your organization that only an admin can grant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admin Grants Consent (One-Time)">
    Your Microsoft tenant administrator must configure consent in Microsoft Entra ID:

    **Access Entra ID:**
    - From Microsoft 365: Click the app launcher (grid icon) in the top-left corner of any Microsoft 365 app → Click **Admin** → From the left sidebar, click **Show All** → Under "Admin centers", select **Identity**
    - From Azure Portal: Click the app launcher (grid icon) in the top-left corner → Select **Entra** from the Microsoft Cloud services

    **Configure User Consent:**
    1. In Entra ID, select **Enterprise apps** from the left sidebar
    2. Under the "Security" section, click **Consent and permissions**
    3. Click **User consent settings**
    4. Select "Allow user consent for apps from verified publishers, for selected permissions" (This allows users to trigger authorization requests from Nexus, since Civic is a verified publisher)
    5. Click **Save** (Important: Save before proceeding to the next step)
    6. Click "Select permissions to classify as low impact" (This whitelists the specific permissions users are allowed to consent to. If prompted to save, click **Save** before moving on)
    7. On the permissions screen, click **Add permissions** → Select **Microsoft Graph**
    8. Select all **OpenId permissions** (required): `openid`, `profile`, `email`
    9. Add the base permissions: `offline_access`, `User.Read`
    10. Add Teams-specific permissions: `Team.ReadBasic.All`, `Channel.ReadBasic.All`, `TeamMember.Read.All`, `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, `ChannelMessage.Send`
    11. Click **Add permissions** then **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait and Retry">
    Wait up to **1 hour** for changes to propagate, then retry authorization in Nexus.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Authorization">
    You'll now see a standard OAuth consent screen showing "Permissions requested" by Civic Nexus. The app will request permissions such as:
    - Maintain access to data you have given it access to
    - Read basic information of all teams
    - Read the names and descriptions of all channels
    - Read and send channel messages
    - View your basic profile

    Click **Accept** to complete the authorization and start using the Microsoft 365 Teams integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Alternative Setup Method:** The steps above use a proactive approach where admins configure permissions up-front. Alternatively, administrators can enable "Admin consent requests" (found in **Admin consent settings** within Entra ID). This allows users to trigger approval requests directly when they attempt to authorize, and admins can approve on-demand rather than pre-configuring permissions.

<Note>
**Channel IDs:** Channel IDs are long strings like `19:xxx@thread.tacv2`. The system retrieves these automatically when you reference channels by name.

**Team IDs:** Team IDs are GUIDs. You can reference teams by name and the system will look them up automatically.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Known Limitations:**
- **Private chats:** Only channel messages are supported (not 1:1 or group chats)
- **File attachments:** Cannot upload files directly to Teams (use OneDrive with share links instead)
- **Channel/team creation:** Cannot create or delete channels or teams (read and message operations only)
</Warning>
