<Note>
**Channel IDs:** Channel IDs are long strings like `19:xxx@thread.tacv2`. The system retrieves these automatically when you reference channels by name.

**Team IDs:** Team IDs are GUIDs. You can reference teams by name and the system will look them up automatically.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Known Limitations:**
- **Private chats:** Only channel messages are supported (not 1:1 or group chats)
- **File attachments:** Cannot upload files directly to Teams (use OneDrive with share links instead)
- **Channel/team creation:** Cannot create or delete channels or teams (read and message operations only)
</Warning>
