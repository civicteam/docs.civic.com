### Sprint Generation
"Create a new folder called 'Sprint 23' in Team Space, then create 5 tasks in it: Implement user authentication (high priority, assigned to me), Design dashboard mockups (urgent), Write API documentation, Fix bug #234, Review pull requests. Set due dates for next Friday and tag them all with 'sprint-23'"

### Team Standup Preparation
"Show me all tasks assigned to me that are 'in progress' status. Then for each task, add a comment with today's progress update. Also show me which tasks are due this week."

### Documentation Sync
"Create a document called 'API Endpoints Documentation'. Find all tasks tagged 'api-endpoint' in the current sprint. For each task, create a page in the document with the task name as title and the task description as content."

<Note>
**Chat Features:** You can send chat messages, but reading messages and creating new channels are not yet available via MCP.

**Server Updates:** ClickUp's MCP server is undergoing active development. Any changes to the remote server may require updates on the Nexus side.
