## Configuration Requirements

    - **Rate Limits**: Be aware of API rate limits based on your account tier
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### API Usage
1. **Service Discovery**: Use `get_service_info` first to understand available operations
2. **Type Understanding**: Use `get_type_info` to understand data structures before requests
3. **Efficient Requests**: Request only the data you need to minimize API usage
4. **Error Handling**: Handle API errors gracefully and respect rate limits

### Business Operations
1. **Read First**: Fetch current state before making updates to business data
2. **Validation**: Validate data formats and requirements before creating or updating resources
3. **Testing**: Test operations with read-only requests before making changes
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly check sales reports and analytics for business insights

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Start by retrieving your business details and exploring your catalog before attempting to make changes. This helps you understand your current Square setup and available data.
