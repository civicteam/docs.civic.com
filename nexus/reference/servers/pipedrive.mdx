## Configuration Requirements

### Authentication Setup
The Pipedrive server uses API Key authentication:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Token" icon="key">
    **Obtaining Your API Token:**
    1. Go to "Personal preferences" under your avatar (top right of the page)
    2. Open the API tab
    3. Generate an API token
    4. Nexus will ask you for this token when you interact with Pipedrive

    **Token Scope:**
    - Full access to your Pipedrive data
    - Read and write permissions for all CRM entities
    - Honors your user permissions and visibility settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account Requirements" icon="building">
    - **Pipedrive Account**: Any Pipedrive plan (Essential, Advanced, Professional, Enterprise)
    - **API Access**: API access is available on all Pipedrive plans
    - **Permissions**: API operations respect your user role and visibility settings
    - **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Pipedrive's API rate limits (varies by plan)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Server Configuration
- **Transport**: STDIO-hosted (local Hub Bridge required)
- **Hub Bridge**: Uses `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge` for authentication and requests
- **API Integration**: Direct connection to Pipedrive's REST API v1
- **Type**: Experimental - Active development with expanding capabilities

<Note>
The Pipedrive server requires Hub Bridge for authentication management and API request handling.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Deal Management
1. **Pipeline First**: Use `get_pipelines` and `get_stages` to understand your sales structure before creating deals
2. **Status Tracking**: Use appropriate status values (open, won, lost) to maintain accurate pipeline metrics
3. **Deal Associations**: Link deals to persons and organizations for complete relationship tracking
4. **Batch Operations**: Use batch tools when creating or updating multiple deals for better performance

### Contact Management
1. **Organization Links**: Associate persons with organizations to maintain company relationships
2. **Search Efficiency**: Use search tools with specific fields for faster results
3. **Visibility Settings**: Configure appropriate visibility levels based on team structure
4. **Data Quality**: Maintain consistent email and phone formats for better data integrity

### Activity Planning
1. **Activity Types**: Choose appropriate types (call, meeting, task) based on the action required
2. **Due Dates**: Always set due dates and times for accountability
3. **Association**: Link activities to relevant deals, persons, or organizations for context
4. **Completion Tracking**: Mark activities as done to track team productivity

### Pipeline Configuration
1. **Stage Progression**: Order stages logically from initial contact to closed won/lost
2. **Probability Mapping**: Set realistic win probabilities for each stage
3. **Rotten Deal Alerts**: Configure rotten_days to identify stalled deals
4. **Active Management**: Use order_nr to control stage display order

### Note Management
1. **Pinning Strategy**: Pin important notes for quick visibility but avoid over-pinning
2. **Context Linking**: Always attach notes to deals, persons, or organizations
3. **Batch Creation**: Use batch operations when adding notes to multiple entities
4. **Content Quality**: Write clear, concise notes that provide value for future reference

<Warning>
Pipedrive has API rate limits that vary by plan. Use batch operations when possible and implement proper error handling for rate limit responses.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Start with read operations (`get_pipelines`, `get_deals`, `get_persons`) to understand your Pipedrive structure before implementing create/update operations.
</Tip>
