<Note>
**Property ID Format:** Accepts either a number (e.g., 123456789) or string format "properties/123456789".

**Report Limits:** Both run_realtime_report and run_report return maximum 10 rows per request. Use offset for pagination to retrieve additional data.

**Date Ranges:** Supports absolute dates ("2025-01-01") and relative dates ("yesterday", "today", "30daysAgo").

**Filtering:** Uses Google Analytics Data API FilterExpression with support for:
- Simple filters (string_filter, numeric_filter, in_list_filter, empty_filter)
- NOT expressions
- AND/OR group filters
- Independent dimension_filter and metric_filter application

**Filter Limitations:** dimension_filter and metric_filter are applied independently. Complex combinations like `(dimension1 AND metric1) OR (dimension2 AND metric2)` require multiple report requests or client-side filtering.

**Dimensions & Metrics:**
- run_realtime_report: Only realtime dimensions and metrics from [Realtime API Schema](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/realtime-api-schema)
- run_report: Standard dimensions/metrics from [API Schema](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema) plus custom dimensions/metrics from get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics

**Ordering:** Use OrderBy objects to sort by dimensions (with order_type: ALPHANUMERIC, CASE_INSENSITIVE, NUMERIC) or metrics in ascending/descending order.
