# DeepWiki Server

## Overview

The DeepWiki server provides programmatic access to GitHub repository documentation and question-answering capabilities. Built by [Cognition Labs](https://cognition.ai) (creators of Devin AI), this server transforms any public GitHub repository into interactive, conversational documentation that AI assistants can access and query.

**Key Feature**: Completely free for public repositories with no authentication required.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to DeepWiki">
    Add the DeepWiki server to your Nexus environment through the server directory. No authentication is required for public repositories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Exploring">
    On the Nexus Chat tab, ask about any public GitHub repository. For example: "Give me an overview of the facebook/react repository"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deep Dive">
    DeepWiki will automatically access the repository's documentation and provide AI-powered insights and answers based on the codebase.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Requirements

### Authentication Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Public Repositories (Free)" icon="unlock">
    **No Authentication Required**
    - Completely free access to all public GitHub repositories
    - No API keys or OAuth required
    - No rate limits for reasonable usage
    - Works immediately upon server connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Private Repositories (Devin Account)" icon="lock">
    **Requires Devin.ai Account**
    - Sign up for a Devin.ai account
    - OAuth authentication to obtain Devin API key
    - Access private repositories in your GitHub account
    - Subject to Devin.ai account tier limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Repository Requirements
- Repository must be indexed on DeepWiki.com
- Public repositories are automatically accessible
- Private repositories require Devin.ai authentication

## Best Practices

### Documentation Exploration Workflow
1. **Start with Structure**: Use `read_wiki_structure` to see available topics
2. **Targeted Reading**: Use `read_wiki_contents` for specific topics of interest
3. **Quick Questions**: Use `ask_question` for specific queries without full navigation
4. **Iterative Learning**: Combine structure, content, and questions for comprehensive understanding

### Effective Questioning
1. **Be Specific**: Ask targeted questions about specific features or implementations
2. **Provide Context**: Include repository names and specific areas of interest
3. **Progressive Detail**: Start with broad questions, then drill down into specifics
4. **Comparative Queries**: Compare implementations across repositories when relevant

### Repository Analysis
1. **Overview First**: Get a high-level summary before diving into details
2. **Architecture Focus**: Understand architectural patterns before implementation details
3. **Documentation Priority**: Review official documentation before asking custom questions
4. **Verification**: Cross-reference answers with actual repository code when possible

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Start with "Give me an overview of [owner/repository]" to understand the project's purpose and structure, then use `read_wiki_structure` to see what specific documentation is available.
</Tip>
