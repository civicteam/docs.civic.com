## Overview

The Context7 server provides AI assistants with access to [Context7](https://context7.com), a globally-accessible RAG service for library source code and documentation. It delivers real code snippets and examples rather than theoretical documentation, helping improve LLM accuracy when working with library code.

## How to Add Context7

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Context7 Account">
    1. Go to [https://context7.com](https://context7.com)
    2. Sign in with your preferred method
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    1. Visit the [Context7 dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard)
    2. Copy your generated API key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Nexus">
    1. Add the Context7 server to your Nexus environment
    2. Enter your API key when prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Start with a simple command like "How to handle authentication in Next.js?" to verify the connection works properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Context7 works best when combined with other developer tools like GitHub, Socket, and Semgrep in a "coder's toolkit" within your IDE.

## Use Cases

### Integration Help
"Can you tell me how to integrate @civic/auth?" - Get specific integration instructions with code examples.

### Framework Learning
"How to handle authentication in Next.js?" - Learn best practices with real-world code snippets.

### API Discovery

<Note>
Context7 is one of the most widely-used engineering MCP servers. It provides real code snippets and examples, not just theoretical documentation, and uses embedding search to make targeted queries.

When integrated into a developer toolkit with GitHub, Socket, and other tools, you can configure Nexus to prefer specific libraries or languages without having to provide that context in every prompt.
