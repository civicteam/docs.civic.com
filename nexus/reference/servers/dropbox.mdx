## Configuration Requirements

### Authentication Setup
The Dropbox server uses OAuth2 authentication with specific file access scopes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth Scopes" icon="key">
    **Required Permissions:**
    - **files.metadata.read**: Read file and folder metadata (for search operations)
    - **files.content.read**: Read file content (for comprehensive access)
    - **files.content.write**: Write and upload files (for upload operations)

    **Tool-Specific Scopes:**
    - `search` and `search_file_db`: files.metadata.read
    - `upload_file`: files.content.read + files.content.write
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account Requirements" icon="building">
    - **Dropbox Account**: Personal or business Dropbox account
    - **Storage Space**: Sufficient storage for upload operations
    - **API Access**: Dropbox API access enabled (typically available for all accounts)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Server Configuration
- **Transport**: STDIO-hosted (requires Hub Bridge)
- **Hub Bridge**: Uses `npx -y @civic/hub-bridge` for OAuth authentication
- **File Encoding**: Base64 encoding required for file uploads
- **Path Format**: Unix-style paths (e.g., "/folder/subfolder/file.ext")

<Note>
The Dropbox server requires Hub Bridge for secure OAuth token management and API interactions.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### File Search Strategies
1. **Start Broad**: Use general terms first, then narrow down with specific keywords
2. **Use Extensions**: Include file extensions (.pdf, .xlsx, .png) to filter by type
3. **Folder-Specific**: Use `search_file_db` when you know the approximate location
4. **Pagination**: Use max_results parameter to control search result volume

### File Upload Guidelines
1. **Path Planning**: Use clear, descriptive folder structures (e.g., "/projects/2024/reports/")
2. **File Naming**: Use descriptive names with dates or version numbers
3. **Encoding Verification**: Ensure proper base64 encoding before upload
4. **Size Considerations**: Be aware of file size limits and account storage capacity

### Organization & Management
1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent file naming conventions for better searchability
2. **Folder Structure**: Maintain organized folder hierarchies for efficient searching
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically search for and organize files to maintain structure
4. **Backup Strategy**: Use uploads to create backups of important generated content

### Integration Workflows
1. **Document Generation**: Generate content and immediately upload to Dropbox for storage
2. **Research Workflows**: Search for existing files before creating new documents
3. **Collaboration**: Upload files to shared folders for team access
4. **Archive Management**: Use search to maintain and organize historical files

<Warning>
Always verify file paths and ensure you have appropriate permissions before uploading files. Incorrect paths may create unintended folder structures.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Combine search operations with upload operations - search for existing files first to avoid duplicates, then upload new versions with updated names.
</Tip>
