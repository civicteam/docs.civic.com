## Overview

The AWS Billing server provides comprehensive cost management and optimization capabilities for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) accounts, enabling you to track spending, analyze cost trends, detect anomalies, and identify optimization opportunities across your cloud infrastructure.

## How to Add AWS Billing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create IAM User">
    1. Log in to your AWS Console
    2. Navigate to **IAM > Users**
    3. Create a new user with programmatic access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach Required Policies">
    Attach the following AWS managed policies to the IAM user:
    - `ViewOnlyAccess` or `AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess` (core billing)
    - `CostOptimizationHubReadOnlyAccess` (must enable in us-east-1)
    - `ComputeOptimizerReadOnlyAccess` (requires opt-in)
    - `AWSBudgetsReadOnlyAccess` (budget status)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Access Keys">
    1. Select the user and go to **Security credentials**
    2. Create an access key for programmatic access
    3. Save your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

  <Step title="Connect to Nexus">
    1. Add the AWS Billing server to your Nexus environment
    2. Enter your AWS credentials when prompted
