## Security Guardrails

The Mistral OCR server has built-in security constraints:

### PII Redaction

<Note>
Personally identifiable information (SSN, credit cards, phone numbers, emails) detected in OCR output is automatically redacted to prevent data leakage.
</Note>

### Input Validation

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Base64 Size Limit | Blocks payloads over ~10MB to prevent memory exhaustion |
| Block Internal URLs | Prevents SSRF attacks by blocking localhost and private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x) |

## Known Limitations

### URL Requirements
- URLs must be publicly accessible
- Internal/private network URLs are blocked for security
- URLs without clear file extensions require explicit `type` parameter

### File Size
- Base64-encoded documents are limited to ~10MB
- For larger documents, use the `ocr_url` tool with a public URL

### Document Types
- Only supports images (PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF) and PDFs
- Scanned documents with poor quality may have reduced accuracy
- Handwritten text recognition may be limited

### PII Handling
- PII is automatically redacted from responses
- If you need unredacted data, contact your administrator to adjust guardrails
