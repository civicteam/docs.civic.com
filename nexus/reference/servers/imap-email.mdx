## Overview

The IMAP Email server provides read and management access to any IMAP-compatible email provider, including self-hosted servers. It supports searching, reading, organizing, and managing emails across folders.

<Note>
**Read-only by design:** This server cannot send or compose emails. It is designed for reading and managing existing emails only.
</Note>

## How to Add IMAP Email

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Server">
    Add the IMAP Email server to your Nexus environment through the server directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Credentials">
    Provide your IMAP connection details:
    - **IMAP host** — your email provider's IMAP server
    - **Username** — your email address
    - **Password** — your password or app-specific password
    - **Port** — usually 993 for SSL (default)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Try "List all my email folders" to verify the connection works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**App-specific passwords:** Some email providers with 2FA enabled require app-specific passwords instead of your regular password. Check your email provider's security settings if you have trouble connecting.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Email UIDs:** Most operations use email UIDs (unique identifiers). Use `list_emails` or `search_emails` first to get UIDs before reading or managing specific emails.

**Folder names:** Use `list_folders` to discover available folder names. Common folders include INBOX, Sent, Drafts, Trash, and Archive, but names vary by provider.

**Batch operations:** Delete, move, copy, and mark operations support multiple UIDs at once for efficiency.

**Date format:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format for date searches (e.g. `2025-01-15`).
