  <Step title="Connect to n8n">
    Add the n8n server to your Nexus environment through the server directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure API Access">
    Provide your n8n instance API URL and API key for authentication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Start with a simple command like `list workflows` to verify the connection works properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>
