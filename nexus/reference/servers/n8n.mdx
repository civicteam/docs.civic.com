  <Step title="Connect to n8n">
    Add the n8n server to your Nexus environment through the server directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure API Access">
    Provide your n8n instance API URL and API key for authentication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Start with a simple command like `list workflows` to verify the connection works properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    - **Webhook Credentials** (optional): Username/password for webhook authentication
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Default Settings" icon="gear">
    - **Default API URL**: `https://n8n.civic.com/api/v1`
    - **Default Webhook Username**: `username`
