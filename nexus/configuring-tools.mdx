## Two Ways to Configure Tools

You can configure which tools your AI assistant can access in two ways:

1. **On nexus.civic.com** - Browse and select tools before connecting your AI
2. **In AI chat** - Configure tools directly in conversation after connecting

## Method 1: Web Configuration (nexus.civic.com)

### Browse Available Tools

Visit **nexus.civic.com** to see all 50+ available tools:

- **Development**: GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira
- **Communication**: Slack, Discord, Telegram
- **Productivity**: Google Drive, Notion, Airtable
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **Marketing**: ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, Mailchimp
- **And many more...**

### Select Your Tools

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse Categories">
    Tools are organized by category (Development, Communication, etc.) for easy discovery
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click to Add">
    Click on any tool to add it to your configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Selection">
    See your selected tools in the sidebar before connecting
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Connection Details">
    Copy your MCP URL or Hub Bridge installation command
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Benefits of Web Configuration

- **Visual browsing** of all available tools
- **Detailed descriptions** of what each tool does
- **Pre-selection** before connecting your AI
- **Easy management** of your tool collection

## Method 2: In-Chat Configuration

After connecting your AI client to Nexus, you can configure tools directly in conversation:

### Adding New Tools

```
"Connect me to GitHub and Slack"
"Add the PostgreSQL server for our database"
"Show me what tools are available to connect"
"I need access to Google Drive"
```

### Managing Existing Tools

```
"What tools do I have connected?"
"Disconnect from Slack"
"Show me my GitHub connection status"
"Update my database connection settings"
```

### Discovery and Help

```
"What MCP servers are available?"
"How do I connect to Notion?"
"What can I do with the GitHub integration?"
"Help me set up ActiveCampaign"
```

### Benefits of Chat Configuration

- **Natural language** setup process
- **Contextual** tool selection based on your current task
- **Just-in-time** configuration when you need specific tools
- **Guided setup** with AI assistance

## Authentication Process

Regardless of how you configure tools, you'll need to authenticate:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorization Request">
    When you first use a tool, you'll be prompted to authorize access
  </Step>
  <Step title="OAuth Flow">
    A browser window opens to the service's authentication page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    Review and approve the specific permissions your AI will have
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to AI">
    Close the browser and return to your AI - the tool is now connected
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**One-time setup**: You only need to authenticate each tool once. Nexus securely manages tokens and handles refresh automatically.
</Note>

## Managing Your Configuration

### View Connected Tools

Ask your AI:
```
"What tools do I have access to?"
"Show my connected services"
"List my MCP servers"
```

### Update Tool Settings

Some tools allow configuration updates:
```
"Change my Slack default channel to #general"
"Update my GitHub repository filter"
"Show PostgreSQL connection settings"
```

### Remove Tools

```
"Disconnect from Slack"
"Remove the PostgreSQL server"
"Revoke GitHub access"
```

<Warning>
Removing a tool will immediately revoke its access and require re-authentication if you want to use it again.
</Warning>

## Tool-Specific Configuration

Some tools have specific configuration options:

### GitHub
- Repository access (public, private, or specific repos)
- Organization permissions
- Webhook settings for real-time updates

### Slack
- Workspace access
- Channel permissions (read, write, manage)
- Bot capabilities

### Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Connection strings
- Read-only vs read-write access
- Query timeout settings
- Schema restrictions

### Google Drive
- Folder access permissions
- File type restrictions
- Sharing capabilities

## Best Practices

### Start Small
Begin with 2-3 essential tools rather than connecting everything at once. This makes it easier to:
- Learn how each integration works
- Troubleshoot any issues
- Build confidence with AI tool usage

### Review Permissions
When authenticating, carefully review what access you're granting:
- ✅ Read access to public repositories
- ⚠️ Write access to important data
- ❌ Admin permissions unless necessary

### Regular Audits
Periodically review your connected tools:
```
"Show me what tools I have connected"
"When did I last use each tool?"
"What permissions have I granted?"
```

### Use Descriptive Requests
Be specific when adding tools:
- Instead of: "Add GitHub"
- Try: "Connect to GitHub so I can manage issues in my work repositories"

This helps ensure you get the right level of access for your needs.

## Common Configuration Scenarios

### For Developers
```
"Connect me to GitHub, Linear, and Slack"
"Add PostgreSQL access for our main database"
"Set up the staging environment database connection"
```

### For Marketing Teams
```
"Connect ActiveCampaign and Google Drive"
"Add HubSpot for our CRM data"
"Set up Slack for team notifications"
```

### For Operations Teams
```
"Connect to our Google Workspace (Drive, Sheets, Calendar)"
"Add Slack and Notion for team coordination"
"Set up database access for reporting"
```

## Troubleshooting Configuration

### Tool Won't Connect
1. Check if the service is supported on nexus.civic.com
2. Verify you have the necessary permissions in the service
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
4. Check the troubleshooting guide for service-specific issues

### Authentication Fails
1. Ensure you're logged into the service in your browser
2. Check for popup blockers preventing OAuth windows
3. Try using an incognito/private browser window
4. Contact the service administrator if using enterprise accounts

### Tool Not Appearing in Chat
1. Verify the tool is actually connected: "What tools do I have?"
2. Try refreshing your AI client connection
3. Check if the tool requires specific activation steps
4. Restart your AI client if using Hub Bridge
