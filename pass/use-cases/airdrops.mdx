## Keeping Airdrops Fair and Secure

Crypto airdrops have become a popular token distribution method, drawing both genuine users and malicious actors. Airdrop farming and Sybil attacks, where fake identities are used to claim excessive tokens, are common exploits.

These actions lead to unfair token distribution and market manipulation. Projects often respond by banning suspected farmers and removing illicit points, which can devalue tokens and erode trust.

A proactive approach is needed as the crypto industry turns to blockchain-based identity solutions to enhance airdrop security. Decentralized identity frameworks promote transparency, trust, and fairness, aligning with Web3's goal of secure, equitable token distributions.

## How to Protect Your Airdrop

For airdrops, two Civic Pass types are especially useful:

* **Uniqueness Pass**: Requires users to complete a video selfie matched to their wallet, confirming each participant is unique and preventing Sybil attacks and farming.

* **ID Verification Pass**: Provides more thorough verification with government-issued document checks, facial comparisons, and compliance with KYC/AML standards, ideal for high-value airdrops.

## Use Cases

Crypto projects can use Civic Passes for preventing bots, Sybil attackers, and farmers from unfairly accumulating tokens during:

* Token Launches: Ensure fair distribution of tokens to genuine community members during initial airdrops.

* Reward Programs: Protect ongoing reward distributions from exploitation by airdrop farmers.

## How Can Civic Help?

* **To keep airdrops fair:** Distribute tokens to real community members, not automated farming operations.

* **For Sybil resistance**: The Uniqueness Pass prevents individuals from creating multiple accounts to unfairly claim airdrop shares.

* **Regulatory compliance**: The ID Verification Pass helps verify the real-world identity of participants, especially useful for high-value airdrops.

* **Flexible configs**: Tailor the level of verification to fit your project's needs and regulatory demands.

* **User privacy**: A Civic Pass is an on-chain token that preserves user privacy.

* **Multichain support**: Supported on 11+ EVM chains and Solana.
