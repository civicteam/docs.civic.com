## How Civic Can Help

DeFi platforms use blockchain for secure trading and ownership, but face challenges with compliance and privacy. **Civic Pass for ID Verification with PII Sharing** solves these issues.

For services involving real-world assets or financial regulations, DeFi platforms must block unauthorized users, including OFAC-sanctioned individuals, non-accredited investors, or those who don’t meet criteria.

Civic Pass lets builders gate smart contract functions, ensuring users can only trade, borrow, lend, or participate in token sales if they meet verification standards.

## How It Works

Users submit their government-issued ID and authorize PII collection. The platform then retrieves an access token from Civic to fetch the PII. After reviewing the evidence and performing checks, the platform decides whether to approve the pass. If approved, Civic issues a blockchain-based attestation with no PII.
