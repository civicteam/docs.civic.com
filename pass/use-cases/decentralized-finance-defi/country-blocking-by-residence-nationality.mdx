## Why Implement Country Blocking?

DeFi platforms face challenges with regulatory compliance and user access across borders. Traditional IP-based geo-blocking is vulnerable to VPNs and proxies, so we combine IP checks with identity verification using government-issued IDs to ensure greater accuracy and security.

## Benefits of Country Blocking

* **Enhanced Accuracy:** Verifying residence or nationality reduces errors that IP-based blocking causes.

* **Improved Compliance:** This approach helps DeFi platforms meet regulations and reduce legal risks.

* **User Trust:** Accurate access controls build trust with users and regulators.

## Use Cases

Residence/nationality-based country blocking addresses several challenges in the DeFi space:

* **Token Sales and ICOs:** Ensure compliance with securities laws by restricting access to token sales based on user residence, preventing participation from restricted jurisdictions.

* **Lending and Borrowing Protocols:** Implement jurisdiction-specific risk assessments and lending terms based on users' verified residences.

* **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):** Control access to certain trading pairs or features based on regulatory requirements in different countries.

* **Yield Farming and Staking:** Manage participation in yield farming or staking programs according to local regulations and tax implications.

* **Governance Participation:** Ensure voting rights and proposal submissions comply with relevant securities and corporate governance laws based on participants' residences.

## How Civic Can Help

Civic Pass, specifically the Civic ID Verification Pass, can effectively be used to implement residence/nationality-based country blocking in DeFi. This multi-tiered approach includes IP checks, VPN detection, and identity verification, making the Civic ID Verification Pass the best option due to its tools and features:

1. **IP and VPN Checks:** Civic Pass begins with verifying the user’s IP address and detecting VPN usage. These layers prevent users from masking their true location, ensuring a stronger baseline of protection for DeFi platforms.

2. **Verification Process:** Users go through a one-time verification process using the Civic ID Verification Pass. This pass verifies the user’s residence or nationality using government-issued ID documents to accurately determine where the user is from.

3. **Tokenized Attestation:** Once verified, a Civic ID Verification Pass is issued as a blockchain-based attestation of the user’s residence/nationality. This pass is more secure than other pass types because it involves actual checks of government-issued documents.

4. **On-Chain Verification:** DeFi protocols can integrate Civic ID Verification Pass checks into their smart contracts to verify user eligibility based on their attested residence/nationality. By combining IP and VPN detection with this attestation, platforms ensure a multi-layered approach to user verification.

5. **Privacy-Preserving: **The verification process uses advanced privacy-preserving techniques so only the necessary info (eligibility based on residence/nationality) is shared and not other personal details.

6. **Updatable and Revocable:** Civic ID Verification Passes can be updated or revoked if a user’s residence changes or if regulatory requirements change, so both users and platforms have flexibility.
