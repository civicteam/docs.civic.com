## Sybil Protection for NFTs

### Understanding Sybil Attacks in NFTs

Sybil attacks present a significant challenge in the NFT space, where actors create multiple fake accounts to manipulate airdrops and gated communities, undermining project integrity and community trust.

A Sybil attack happens when a single entity creates multiple fake identities or wallets to exploit activities like minting, trading, and airdrop participation. Using bots or automated tools, malicious actors can flood the system, falsely inflating user engagement with the project, causing:

* Unfair distribution of NFTs or tokens, frustrating legitimate users during mints or airdrops.

* Damage to reputation and long-term project viability as users lose trust upon noticing manipulation.

* Market instability caused by price manipulation and disruption of normal trading activity.

Adopt a strong on-chain identity gating solution to mitigate these risks.

### Choose the Right Civic Pass

* Uniqueness Pass: Verifies that each wallet is linked to a unique, real person through biometric checks such as liveness detection through a video selfie.

* Liveness Pass: Verifies human presence through real-time video selfies.

* ID Verification Pass: Uses government-issued IDs and facial matching technology to verify identities.

### Implementation

* Ensure your browser supports JavaScript.

* Use a device with a working camera to complete liveness checks during identity verification.

* Disable your VPN.

### Use Cases

1. **NFT Mints:** Civic Pass guarantees each participant in an NFT mint is a verified, unique individual, blocking bots and automated systems from manipulating the drop. By using the Uniqueness Pass, projects can authenticate users through biometric checks, ensuring only real individuals gain access. This promotes fairer distribution and builds trust within the community.

2. **Token-Gated Communities:** Token-gated NFT communities thrive on exclusivity, letting only select users participate based on their NFT holdings. Civic’s Liveness Pass verifies member authenticity, safeguarding the community’s integrity and exclusivity.

3. **Airdrops:** Airdrops are prime targets for Sybil attacks, where malicious actors try to claim an unfair share of tokens. Integrating Civic’s verification methods, such as the ID Verification or Uniqueness Pass, ensures only eligible, unique users receive tokens. This prevents duplicate claims and upholds fairness in the distribution process.

### Key Benefits

* **Fair Participation:** Civic Pass ensures each participant is unique, maintaining fairness and transparency in mints, airdrops, and token-gated communities while minimizing manipulation.

* **Scalability:** Civic’s solutions work across major blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, enabling secure, flexible scaling for NFT projects without compromising identity verification.

* **Privacy Protection:** Civic’s verification process minimizes data collection and never stores personal information on-chain, prioritizing user privacy while preventing Sybil attacks—ideal for privacy-conscious NFT communities.

* **Force Refresh:** Civic Pass includes a force refresh feature, allowing NFT projects to re-validate users dynamically before they access gated content or claim rewards, ensuring only validated users participate.
