## Keep Your Rewards Distribution Fair

Trying to protect the integrity of your game and your rewards distribution? Game developers can now verify player uniqueness and ensure rewards go to legitimate players and not bots.

Civic Pass allows game developers to implement a force refresh mechanism, ensuring that players' identities and wallet control are verified in real time before claiming rewards. This adds an extra layer of security to the rewards distribution process, protecting both the game economy and honest players.

* **Real-Time Verification:** By implementing a forced refresh of Civic Pass with a simple feature flag at the point of reward claiming, developers can ensure that the player still has control of their wallet and meets the criteria.

* **Prevent Reward Farming:** The ability to expire passes and re-check a player's status helps prevent sophisticated farming techniques that might otherwise exploit the reward system.

* **Flexible Integration:** Civic Pass can be easily integrated into existing game architectures, allowing developers to implement secure reward claiming without overhauling their entire system.

* **Multichain Support:** With support for multiple blockchains, Civic Pass can be used across various gaming platforms and ecosystems.

## Pick the Right Civic Pass

1. **Liveness Pass:** Requires a video selfie to prove that a real person is claiming rewards.

2. **Uniqueness Pass:** Combines liveness check with additional measures to prevent one person from creating more than one account.

3. **ID Verification Pass:** Provides the highest level of verification, including government ID checks. It is suitable for games with high-value rewards.

For most gaming projects, Liveness or Uniqueness Pass strikes the right balance between security and user experience. We recommend ID Verification Passes when rewards can be easily converted into money or money-like assets.

## How Civic Can Help

* **Daily Rewards**: Use Civic Pass to verify unique, legit players for daily login rewards.

* **Tournament Prizes**: Verify winnersâ€™ identities and wallet control before awarding large prizes.

* **Limited-Time Events**: Use force refresh to protect valuable rewards during special in-game events.

* **Play-to-Earn Models**: Ensure only legitimate players claim rewards.

* **Fair Competition**: Stop artificial boosting and resource exploitation by verifying player uniqueness.

* **Moderation**: Enforce rules more easily and prevent banned players from rejoining.
