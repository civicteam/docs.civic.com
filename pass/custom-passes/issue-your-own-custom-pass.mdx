With Custom Pass, builders can write their own rules, bring in other verification services or customize/bundle several of the Civic Pass functions into a single pass that lives on-chain.

## Custom Pass Architecture

  <img src="/images/pass/custom-passes/image-1.png" />
</Frame>

Once a user has been successfully vetted according to your logic, you can then call the Civic API to issue a Custom Pass to your user's wallet. The API also enables you to manage the complete lifecycle of any Custom Pass you issued (refresh, revocation, expiry, burning).

</Frame>

As you are integrating, remember that your on-chain smart contract or app still has to check for a valid Custom Pass during program execution.

To enable gating logic using a Custom Pass, you will need:

* Civic Pass API integration to enable issuing and managing the Custom Pass for your dApp

<Info>
**See here for the full** [**OpenAPI specification**](/api-reference/introduction).
</Info>

* On-Chain library to enable your smart contract to check for valid Civic Pass during program execution. See the On-Chain section in the integration guide for your chain.

Please [reach out](https://civickey.typeform.com/req-custom) to discuss your use case and obtain the key to enable your pass network.

## Supported Custom Pass Chains

The Civic Pass API supports the following chains and chain networks:

* `solana/mainnet-beta`

* `solana/devnet`

* `ethereum/homestead`

* `ethereum/arbitrumGoerli`

* `ethereum/arbitrumMainnet`

* `ethereum/arbitrumSepolia`

* `ethereum/goerli`

* `ethereum/avalancheCChain`

* `ethereum/avalancheCChainFuji`

* `ethereum/baseSepolia`

* `ethereum/baseMainnet`

* `ethereum/fantomMainnet`

* `ethereum/fantomTestnet`

* `ethereum/mainnet`

* `ethereum/optimismGoerli`

* `ethereum/optimismMainnet`

* `ethereum/polygonMainnet`

* `ethereum/polygonMumbai`

* `ethereum/polygonZKEVM`

* `ethereum/polygonZKEVMTestnet`

* `ethereum/xdcMainnet`

* `ethereum/xdcApothem`

## Testing

### API Functionality

You can try out the Civic Pass API by using the following demo credentials to generate an OAuth token:

* `client_id: j5kwZ68j4bM8fdPAYKu7DlGQGr37eNPs`

* `client_secret: S1qSiacDUDPRVfxiSvwsRASxE0fH47U60eYeNYIt4JKSVSsgo2yy0n6V-Uz1IYBK`

Keep in mind that since these are *shared credentials*, others have access to the same Civic Passes and can, for example, freeze them.

*The demo credentials only work for these development networks:*

* `solana/devnet`

* `ethereum/goerli`

* `ethereum/polygonMumbai`

* `ethereum/xdcApothem`

* `ethereum/arbitrumGoerli`

* `ethereum/fantomTestnet`

### On-Chain Integration
