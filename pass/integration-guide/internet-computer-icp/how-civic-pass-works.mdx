## Overview

This guide explains how users obtain credentials and how applications can verify them.

## User Credential Flow

### 1. Obtaining a Credential

* User visits [https://icp-getpass.civic.com/](https://icp-getpass.civic.com/)

* Completes the chosen verification (CAPTCHA, Uniqueness, or Age)

* Upon successful verification, credential is stored in Civic Pass canister (73ncn-4qaaa-aaaag-alddq-cai)

### 2. Using the Credential

* User visits an application that requires Civic Pass verification

* Application requests the user's credential

* User chooses to present their stored credential

* ICP automatically maps the credential between principals

## Application Integration Flow

### 1. Credential Request

* Application detects need for verification

* Requests user's credential using their principal ID

* Civic Pass canister handles credential retrieval

### 2. Principal Mapping

* User's original credential was obtained with their principal from icp-getpass.civic.com

* Application sees user with a different principal

* ICP handles mapping between these principals automatically

* No special handling needed by applications

### 3. Verification

* Application receives verified credential

* Can proceed with protected operations

## Testing and Development

* Live demo available at[ https://icp-sign.civic.me/](https://icp-sign.civic.me/)

* Demonstrates complete verification flow

* Uses same underlying mechanisms as production

* Perfect for testing implementations

## Next Steps
