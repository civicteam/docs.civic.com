Use this prompt with your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to automatically integrate Civic Auth into your Next.js project.

## How to Use

1. Copy the prompt below
2. Paste it into your AI assistant
3. The assistant will ask for your project details and guide you through the setup
4. The assistant will fetch the complete documentation and implement the integration for you

## Integration Prompt

# Civic Auth Integration Prompt

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you need a Civic Auth Client ID:
1. Visit https://auth.civic.com
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new application to obtain your Client ID
4. Copy the Client ID for use in this integration

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication to this Next.js application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/nextjs.md

This documentation contains ALL the code examples and instructions needed for the integration. Do NOT use web search or any other tools - only use curl to fetch this specific URL.

## Step 2: Gather Project Information
Ask the user for the following information if not provided:

**Required Information (gather ALL before starting):**
- ✅ Client ID (if not provided, ask user to get it from https://auth.civic.com)
- ✅ Project type (new/existing Next.js project)
- ✅ Web3 Support Needed (Yes/No) - This affects which imports and packages to use
- ✅ Protected routes that need authentication (e.g., /dashboard/*, /api/private/*)
- ✅ Existing authentication systems that need replacement

**DO NOT proceed with implementation until you have confirmed ALL of the above information.**

If any information is missing, ask specific questions and wait for responses before continuing. This prevents errors and ensures the integration matches the user's exact requirements.

## Step 3: Create Implementation Plan
After fetching the documentation with curl:
1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Identify which code examples from the documentation apply
3. Choose the correct setup based on Web3 requirements:
   - **If Web3 support needed**: Use "Auth + Web3" tab and @civic/auth-web3 packages
   - **If no Web3 support**: Use "Auth" tab and @civic/auth packages
4. Plan the implementation order
5. Note any existing code that needs to be modified

## Step 4: Implement Civic Auth
Using ONLY the documentation fetched via curl:
1. Follow the Quick Start guide step by step
2. Choose the correct tab based on Web3 requirements:
   - **If Web3 support needed**: Use "Auth + Web3" tab (imports from @civic/auth-web3/react)
   - **If no Web3 support**: Use "Auth" tab (imports from @civic/auth)
3. Adapt all code examples to this project's structure
4. Handle any existing middleware or auth code appropriately

## Important Notes
- Use ONLY curl to fetch the documentation - no web search tools
- The fetched documentation is the ONLY source of truth for this implementation
- All code examples, configuration options, and setup instructions are in that document
- Pay attention to version requirements and security warnings in the documentation
- **CRITICAL**: If Web3 support is needed, you MUST use @civic/auth-web3 packages and imports, not @civic/auth

## CRITICAL: Middleware File Location
The middleware.ts file MUST be placed at src/middleware.ts (in the src/ directory), NOT in the project root. This is a common mistake that breaks authentication:
- ✅ CORRECT: src/middleware.ts 
- ❌ WRONG: middleware.ts (project root - breaks authentication)

The middleware file should be placed in the src/ directory as shown in the documentation examples. Placing it in the project root will cause the middleware to not take effect and authentication will fail.

## Next Steps
After completing basic authentication integration:
- **If Web3 was selected**: Use dedicated [Solana Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/solana-embedded-wallets) or [Ethereum Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/ethereum-embedded-wallets) prompts to add specific wallet functionality
- **If no Web3**: Your basic authentication setup is complete
```

<Note>
  **Need Web3?** After setting up basic authentication, use our dedicated [Solana Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/solana-embedded-wallets) or [Ethereum Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/ethereum-embedded-wallets) prompts to add wallet functionality.

## What the AI Assistant Will Do

When you use this prompt, the AI assistant will:

1. **Fetch the documentation** using curl from the official Civic Auth docs
2. **Analyze your project** structure and requirements
3. **Install dependencies** and configure your Next.js app
4. **Set up authentication** with proper middleware and routes
5. **Implement frontend components** for login/logout functionality
6. **Handle edge cases** like existing auth systems or custom configurations
