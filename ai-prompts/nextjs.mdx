Use this prompt with your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to automatically integrate Civic Auth into your Next.js project.

## How to Use

1. Copy the prompt below
2. Paste it into your AI assistant
3. The assistant will ask for your project details and guide you through the setup
4. The assistant will fetch the complete documentation and implement the integration for you

## Integration Prompt

```text
# Civic Auth Integration Prompt

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you need a Civic Auth Client ID:
1. Visit https://auth.civic.com
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new application to obtain your Client ID
4. Copy the Client ID for use in this integration

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication to this Next.js application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/nextjs.md

This documentation contains ALL the code examples and instructions needed for the integration. Do NOT use web search or any other tools - only use curl to fetch this specific URL.

## Project Context
Ask the user for the following information if not provided:

- **Client ID**: If not provided, ask the user to visit https://auth.civic.com, sign up/log in, create a new application, and provide their Client ID
- **Project Type**: Ask if this is a new or existing Next.js project
- **Web3 Required**: Ask if they need Web3 features (Yes/No)
- **Protected Routes**: Ask which routes need authentication (e.g., /dashboard/*, /api/private/*)
- **Existing Auth**: Ask if there's any existing authentication that needs to be replaced

## Step 2: Create Implementation Plan
After fetching the documentation with curl:
1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Identify which code examples from the documentation apply
3. Plan the implementation order
4. Note any existing code that needs to be modified

## Step 3: Implement Civic Auth
Using ONLY the documentation fetched via curl:
1. Follow the Quick Start guide step by step
2. Choose the correct tab ("Auth" or "Auth + Web3") based on requirements
3. Adapt all code examples to this project's structure
4. Handle any existing middleware or auth code appropriately

## Important Notes
- Use ONLY curl to fetch the documentation - no web search tools
- The fetched documentation is the ONLY source of truth for this implementation
- All code examples, configuration options, and setup instructions are in that document
- Pay attention to version requirements and security warnings in the documentation

## CRITICAL: Middleware File Location
The middleware.ts file MUST be placed at src/middleware.ts (in the src/ directory), NOT in the project root. This is a common mistake that breaks authentication:
- ✅ CORRECT: src/middleware.ts 
- ❌ WRONG: middleware.ts (project root - breaks authentication)

The middleware file should be placed in the src/ directory as shown in the documentation examples. Placing it in the project root will cause the middleware to not take effect and authentication will fail.
```

<Note>
  **Need help?** If you encounter any issues during the LLM-assisted integration, you can always fall back to the [manual integration guide](/integration/nextjs).
</Note>

## What the AI Assistant Will Do

When you use this prompt, the AI assistant will:

1. **Fetch the documentation** using curl from the official Civic Auth docs
2. **Analyze your project** structure and requirements
3. **Install dependencies** and configure your Next.js app
4. **Set up authentication** with proper middleware and routes
5. **Implement frontend components** for login/logout functionality
6. **Handle edge cases** like existing auth systems or custom configurations

## Supported AI Assistants
