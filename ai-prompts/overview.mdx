# AI-Assisted Integration

Use AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, or other LLMs to automatically integrate Civic Auth into your project. These prompts provide step-by-step instructions that AI assistants can follow to implement authentication in your application.

## Available Framework Prompts

## Web3 AI Prompts

<Card title="Embedded Wallets" href="/ai-prompts/embedded-wallets" icon="wallet">
  Add Solana or Ethereum/EVM embedded wallet functionality to existing Civic Auth projects
</Card>

## How to Use These Prompts

### For New Projects
1. **Start with basic authentication** using [React](/ai-prompts/react) or [Next.js](/ai-prompts/nextjs) prompts
2. **Add Web3 functionality** (optional) using [Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/embedded-wallets) prompts
3. **Copy the appropriate prompt** and paste it into your AI assistant
4. **Follow the AI's step-by-step instructions**

### For Existing Projects
1. **Add Web3 functionality** to your existing Civic Auth integration using the [embedded wallets prompts](/ai-prompts/embedded-wallets)
2. **Choose your blockchain platform** (Solana or Ethereum/EVM)
3. **Copy the appropriate prompt** and paste it into your AI assistant

## Web3 Integration Features

Our focused embedded wallet prompts provide:

- **Prerequisites Checking**: Ensures basic Civic Auth is set up first
- **Embedded Wallets**: Automatically create non-custodial wallets for users
- **Platform-Specific**: Dedicated prompts for Solana and Ethereum/EVM chains
- **Wallet Adapters**: Proper integration with Solana Wallet Adapter and Wagmi
- **Transaction Handling**: Send transactions and check balances
- **Multi-Chain Support**: For Ethereum, support multiple EVM networks

## Benefits of AI-Assisted Integration

- **Faster setup** - Let AI handle the boilerplate code
- **Fewer errors** - AI follows tested patterns and best practices
- **Modular approach** - Separate prompts for authentication and Web3 features
- **Customization** - AI can adapt the integration to your specific needs
- **Learning** - Understand the integration process as AI explains each step

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
Make sure to mention your specific project structure and requirements when using the prompts. For Web3 projects, start with basic authentication first, then add embedded wallet functionality using the dedicated prompts.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Always review the AI-generated code before implementing it in production. While these prompts are designed to produce working code, it's important to understand what's being added to your project, especially for Web3 integrations involving wallet management.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Start simple**: Use basic authentication prompts first, then add Web3 features
- **One feature at a time**: Don't try to implement everything at once
- **Customize the prompts**: These prompts are starting points. Modify them based on your specific requirements
- **Keep them updated**: As you discover patterns that work well, update your prompts
- **Version control**: Store your prompts in your repository so your team can benefit from them
- **Security first**: Always review AI-generated code for security best practices, especially for Web3 wallet integrations
- **Test thoroughly**: For Web3 integrations, test wallet creation, transactions, and error handling on testnets first
