# Replit Integration - Coming Soon

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸš§">
  **We're testing the waters!**
  
  We're currently working on perfecting the AI prompt for Replit integration to ensure it works seamlessly with Civic Auth. Our team is testing various scenarios to make sure the integration is smooth and reliable.
  
  **Please check back here soon** - we'll have the Replit prompt ready shortly!
