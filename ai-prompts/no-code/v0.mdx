Use this prompt with your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to automatically integrate Civic Auth into your V0 project - without V0 suggesting Supabase as an alternative!

## What the AI Assistant Will Do

When you use this prompt with V0, the AI assistant will:

1. **Fetch the documentation** using curl from the official Civic Auth docs
2. **Analyze your V0 project** structure and requirements  
3. **Install dependencies** and configure your Next.js app for V0's environment
4. **Set up authentication** with proper middleware and routes
5. **Configure domain settings** for V0's Vercel-hosted environment
6. **Implement authentication UI** for login/logout functionality
7. **Handle V0-specific considerations** like environment variables and deployment

## Why This Prompt Works with V0

This prompt is specifically designed to prevent V0 from suggesting Supabase or other authentication alternatives. It includes:

- **Explicit instructions** to use only Civic Auth
- **V0-specific domain configuration** for Vercel hosting
- **Clear rejection** of Supabase and other auth providers
- **V0 environment setup** instructions for proper deployment
