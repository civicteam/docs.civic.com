# V0 Integration - Coming Soon

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸš§">
  **We're testing the waters!**
  
  We're currently working on perfecting the AI prompt for V0 integration to ensure it works seamlessly with Civic Auth. Our team is testing various scenarios to make sure the integration is smooth and reliable.
  
  **Please check back here soon** - we'll have the V0 prompt ready shortly!

## What to Expect

When the V0 prompt is ready, it will help you:

- **Automatically integrate Civic Auth** into your V0 projects
- **Handle V0-specific configurations** for Vercel's hosted environment
- **Set up proper domain registration** for V0's platform
- **Implement authentication components** optimized for V0's component-based workflow

1. **Get your Civic Auth setup ready**:
   - Visit [auth.civic.com](https://auth.civic.com) to create your account
   - Create a new application to get your Client ID
