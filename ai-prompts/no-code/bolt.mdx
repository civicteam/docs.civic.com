# Bolt Integration - Coming Soon

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸš§">
  **We're testing the waters!**
  
  We're currently working on perfecting the AI prompt for Bolt integration to ensure it works seamlessly with Civic Auth. Our team is testing various scenarios to make sure the integration is smooth and reliable.
  
  **Please check back here soon** - we'll have the Bolt prompt ready shortly!
</Callout>

## What to Expect

When the Bolt prompt is ready, it will help you:

- **Automatically integrate Civic Auth** into your Bolt projects
- **Handle Bolt-specific configurations** for hosted environments
- **Set up proper domain registration** for Bolt's platform
- **Implement authentication components** optimized for Bolt's workflow

## In the Meantime

While you wait for the Bolt-specific prompt, you can:

1. **Get your Civic Auth setup ready**:
   - Visit [auth.civic.com](https://auth.civic.com) to create your account
   - Create a new application to get your Client ID
   - Prepare your Bolt app's domain for registration

2. **Check out our other prompts**:
   - [Lovable](/ai-prompts/no-code/lovable) - Ready now!
