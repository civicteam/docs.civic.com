Use this prompt with your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to automatically integrate Civic Auth into your React project.

## How to Use

1. Copy the prompt below
2. Paste it into your AI assistant
3. The assistant will ask for your project details and guide you through the setup
4. The assistant will fetch the complete documentation and implement the integration for you

## Integration Prompt

```text
# Civic Auth Integration Prompt

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you need a Civic Auth Client ID:
1. Visit https://auth.civic.com
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new application to obtain your Client ID
4. Copy the Client ID for use in this integration

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication to this React application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/react.md

This documentation contains ALL the code examples and instructions needed for the integration. Do NOT use web search or any other tools - only use curl to fetch this specific URL.

## Step 2: Gather Project Information
Ask the user for the following information if not provided:

**Required Information (gather ALL before starting):**
- ✅ Client ID (if not provided, ask user to get it from https://auth.civic.com)
- ✅ Project type (new/existing React project)
- ✅ Build tool (Create React App, Vite, Next.js, or other)
- ✅ Web3 Support Needed (Yes/No) - This affects which imports and packages to use
- ✅ Protected routes/components that need authentication
- ✅ Existing authentication systems that need replacement

**DO NOT proceed with implementation until you have confirmed ALL of the above information.**

If any information is missing, ask specific questions and wait for responses before continuing. This prevents errors and ensures the integration matches the user's exact requirements.

## Step 3: Create Implementation Plan
After fetching the documentation with curl:
1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Identify which code examples from the documentation apply
3. Choose the correct setup based on Web3 requirements:
   - **If Web3 support needed**: Use "Auth + Web3" tab and @civic/auth-web3 packages
   - **If no Web3 support**: Use "Auth" tab and @civic/auth packages
4. Plan the implementation order
5. Note any existing code that needs to be modified

## Step 4: Implement Civic Auth
Using ONLY the documentation fetched via curl:
1. Follow the Quick Start guide step by step
2. Choose the correct tab based on Web3 requirements:
   - **If Web3 support needed**: Use "Auth + Web3" tab (imports from @civic/auth-web3/react)
   - **If no Web3 support**: Use "Auth" tab (imports from @civic/auth)
3. Adapt all code examples to this project's structure
4. Handle any existing authentication or routing code appropriately

## Important Notes
- Use ONLY curl to fetch the documentation - no web search tools
- The fetched documentation is the ONLY source of truth for this implementation
- All code examples, configuration options, and setup instructions are in that document
- Pay attention to version requirements and compatibility notes in the documentation
- **CRITICAL**: If Web3 support is needed, you MUST use @civic/auth-web3 packages and imports, not @civic/auth

## Next Steps
After completing basic authentication integration:
- **If Web3 was selected**: Use the [Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/embedded-wallets) prompt to add specific wallet functionality (Solana or Ethereum)
- **If no Web3**: Your basic authentication setup is complete
```

<Note>
  **Need Web3?** After setting up basic authentication, use our [Embedded Wallets](/ai-prompts/embedded-wallets) prompt to add wallet functionality.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Need help?** If you encounter any issues during the LLM-assisted integration, you can always fall back to the [manual integration guide](/integration/react).
</Note>

## What the AI Assistant Will Do

When you use this prompt, the AI assistant will:

1. **Fetch the documentation** using curl from the official Civic Auth docs
2. **Analyze your project** structure and requirements
3. **Install dependencies** and configure your React app
4. **Set up authentication provider** and wrap your app correctly
5. **Implement authentication components** for login/logout functionality
6. **Handle edge cases** like existing auth systems or custom routing
