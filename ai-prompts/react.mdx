Use this prompt with your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to automatically integrate Civic Auth into your React project.

## How to Use

1. Copy the prompt below
2. Fill in your project context details
3. Paste it into your AI assistant
4. The assistant will fetch the complete documentation and implement the integration for you

## Integration Prompt

```text
# Civic Auth Integration Prompt

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you need a Civic Auth Client ID:
1. Visit https://auth.civic.com
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new application to obtain your Client ID
4. Copy the Client ID for use in this integration

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication to this React application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/react

This documentation contains ALL the code examples and instructions needed for the integration. Do NOT use web search or any other tools - only use curl to fetch this specific URL.

## Project Context
- **Client ID**: [PROVIDE YOUR CLIENT ID HERE - Get this by signing up at https://auth.civic.com]
- **Project Type**: [New/Existing] React project
- **Build Tool**: [Create React App/Vite/Next.js/Other - specify]
- **Web3 Required**: [Yes/No]
- **Protected Routes/Components**: [List components that need authentication, e.g., Dashboard, Profile, Settings]
- **Existing Auth**: [Describe any existing auth that needs to be replaced]

## Step 2: Create Implementation Plan
After fetching the documentation with curl:
1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Identify which code examples from the documentation apply
3. Plan the implementation order
4. Note any existing code that needs to be modified

## Step 3: Implement Civic Auth
Using ONLY the documentation fetched via curl:
1. Follow the Quick Start guide step by step
2. Choose the correct tab ("Auth" or "Auth + Web3") based on requirements
3. Adapt all code examples to this project's structure
4. Handle any existing authentication or routing code appropriately

## Important Notes
- Use ONLY curl to fetch the documentation - no web search tools
- The fetched documentation is the ONLY source of truth for this implementation
- All code examples, configuration options, and setup instructions are in that document
- Pay attention to version requirements and compatibility notes in the documentation
```

<Note>
  **Need help?** If you encounter any issues during the LLM-assisted integration, you can always fall back to the [manual integration guide](/integration/react).
</Note>

## What the AI Assistant Will Do

When you use this prompt, the AI assistant will:

1. **Fetch the documentation** using curl from the official Civic Auth docs
2. **Analyze your project** structure and requirements
3. **Install dependencies** and configure your React app
4. **Set up authentication provider** and wrap your app correctly
5. **Implement authentication components** for login/logout functionality
6. **Handle edge cases** like existing auth systems or custom routing

## Supported AI Assistants

This prompt has been tested with:
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Cursor** (with Claude or GPT-4)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat**

<Info>
  Make sure your AI assistant has the ability to run terminal commands and edit files in your project.
