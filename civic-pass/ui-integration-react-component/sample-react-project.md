# Sample React Project

We have created an example React project that shows how you would go about integrating the different features provided by our example project on [Github](https://github.com/civicteam/civic-pass-template).&#x20;

We have broken down the project into the following examples, split into Ethereum and Solana examples:

* Civic Verified Badge: A react component that includes a wallet address with an ACTIVE Civic Pass.
* Civic Identity Button: A react component that includes the Identity Button that can be used to test issuing a Civic Pass against a prod and dev environment.
* Solana Wallet Adapter (Solana only): A react component that illustrates how you would integrate the official `@solana/wallet-adapter` .
* Client sent transaction: A react component that will not broadcast the transaction, but instead send the client back a transaction to be signed so a Gateway token can be issue.
