  want to use Civic IDV Services and UI components.

# üìù Issue Your Own Custom Pass

With Custom Pass, builders can write their own rules, bring in other verification services or customize/bundle several of the Civic Pass functions into a single pass that lives on-chain.&#x20;

## Custom Pass Architecture

Once a user has been successfully vetted according to your logic, you can then call the Civic API to issue a Custom Pass to your user's wallet. The API also enables you to manage the complete lifecycle of any Custom Pass you issued (refresh, revocation, expiry, burning).

As you are integrating, remember that your on-chain smart contract or app still has to check for a valid Custom Pass during program execution.

To enable gating logic using a Custom Pass, you will need:

* Civic Pass API integration to enable issuing and managing the Custom Pass for your dApp

{% hint style="info" %}
**See here for the full** [<mark style="color:purple;">**OpenAPI specification**</mark>](https://civicteam.github.io/openapi-docs/)**.**
{% endhint %}

* On-Chain library to enable your smart contract to check for valid Civic Pass during program execution. See the On-Chain section in the integration guide for your chain.&#x20;

Please [reach out](https://civickey.typeform.com/req-custom) to discuss your use case and obtain the key to enable your pass network.&#x20;

## Supported Custom Pass Chains

The Civic Pass API supports the following chains and chain networks:

* `solana/mainnet-beta`
* `solana/devnet`
* `ethereum/homestead`
* `ethereum/arbitrumGoerli`
* `ethereum/arbitrumMainnet`
* `ethereum/arbitrumSepolia`
* `ethereum/goerli`
* `ethereum/avalancheCChain`
* `ethereum/avalancheCChainFuji`
* `ethereum/baseSepolia`
* `ethereum/baseMainnet`
* `ethereum/fantomMainnet`
* `ethereum/fantomTestnet`
* `ethereum/mainnet`
* `ethereum/optimismGoerli`
* `ethereum/optimismMainnet`
* `ethereum/polygonMainnet`
* `ethereum/polygonMumbai`
* `ethereum/polygonZKEVM`
* `ethereum/polygonZKEVMTestnet`
* `ethereum/xdcMainnet`
* `ethereum/xdcApothem`

## Testing

### API Functionality

You can try out the Civic Pass API by using the following demo credentials to generate an OAuth token:

* `client_id: j5kwZ68j4bM8fdPAYKu7DlGQGr37eNPs`
* `client_secret: S1qSiacDUDPRVfxiSvwsRASxE0fH47U60eYeNYIt4JKSVSsgo2yy0n6V-Uz1IYBK`

Keep in mind that since these are _shared credentials_, others have access to the same Civic Passes and can, for example, freeze them.

_The demo credentials only work for these development networks:_

* `solana/devnet`
* `ethereum/goerli`
* `ethereum/polygonMumbai`
* `ethereum/xdcApothem`
* `ethereum/arbitrumGoerli`
* `ethereum/fantomTestnet`

### On-Chain Integration

To test your integration on **testnet**, use this Gatekeeper network address:
