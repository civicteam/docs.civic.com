# Candy Machine v3

We are fully integrated into MetaPlex's Candy Machine v3 protocol to enable mint protection using [<mark style="color:purple;">Candy Guard</mark>](https://developers.metaplex.com/core-candy-machine/guards).

Permissioning with Civic Pass & Candy Guard allows you to verify minters in real-time, evaluating every request to mint by your criteria, including:

* conducting a bot check using CAPTCHA
* checking for liveness and uniqueness
* checking for a minimum age
* checking buyers from locations you want to allow
* checking ID documents

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use our [<mark style="color:purple;">reference implementation UI template using Candy Machine V3 with integrated Civic Pass -></mark>](https://github.com/MarkSackerberg/umi-cmv3-ui-inofficial)

We recommend using the [<mark style="color:purple;">latest sugar command line tool</mark>](https://developers.metaplex.com/candy-machine/sugar) to create your mint.

#### Creating a protected mint using Sugar CLI

In Candy Machine v3 creation of the token guard is separate from the mint.

1. install sugar: currently sugar support for Candy Machine needs to be downloaded [<mark style="color:purple;">here</mark>](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar/releases)
2.  Create your mint (with Candy Machine v3 the mint and the token guard are created separately). Follow the prompts on the CLI:

    ```
    sugar launch
    ```
3.  A config.json should have been created. Edit this file and add a 'guards' section (see the section below for alternative networks):\


    ```
    "guards": {
        "default": {
          "gatekeeper": {
            "gatekeeperNetwork": "ignREusXmGrscGNUesoU9mxfds9AiYTezUKex2PsZV6",
            "expireOnUse": false
          }
        },
        "groups": null
      }
    ```
4.  Create the guard for your mint:

    ```
    sugar guard add
    ```
5.  The script should run successfully and you should see output like below:

    ```
    %  sugar guard add

    ‚úÖ Command successful.

### Enabling Civic Pass Checks

#### CAPTCHA Check

When CAPTCHA is enabled, a user will be issued a Civic Pass after successfully completing a CAPTCHA challenge and automatically checked by the Candy Machine prior to minting.

#### Liveness Check

When liveness is enabled, a user must do a 3D video selfie to prove they are a real person and not a bot before they can mint.

**Uniqueness Check**

When uniqueness is enabled, the user must do a 3D video selfie to ensure that a real person only uses one wallet to mint. You can decide how many NFTs this unique user can mint.

**ID Document Check**

When enabled, the user must provide a government issued ID and complete a 3D video selfie before they they are issued a Civic Pass.

For any of the above keys, please go through the process of requesting access [here](../../introduction/get-network-keys.md). For detailed configuration instructions on how to configure and deploy your mint, please refer to MetaPlex's [<mark style="color:purple;">Sugar repository</mark>](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar).
