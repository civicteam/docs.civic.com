# Rewards Management

### Rewards Management with Biometrics Gating for Online Communities

Online communities live and die by engagement, but managing reward systems fairly is a big challenge. Civic's rewards management solution, powered by an on-demand pass refresh mechanism, solves issues like bot-driven engagement farming, fake accounts, and low-quality participation. By periodically resetting a Uniqueness pass and verifying user identities, this solution ensures rewards are given to legitimate, active users and builds long-term trust and sustainable engagement.\


### Challenges

Online communities face several challenges when managing reward systems:

* **Engagement Manipulation**: Bots and fake accounts inflate metrics, skewing reward distribution and distorting genuine participation.
* **Identity Fraud**: Multiple accounts from the same user disrupt fair reward allocation and allow system exploitation.
* **Sustainability**: Maintaining long-term, authentic engagement is tough when users prioritize quantity over quality for rewards. Communities need systems that encourage valuable, lasting contributions.

### How Civic Can Help

#### Civic Passes with Force Refresh

Civic’s force refresh feature prevents engagement manipulation by periodically resetting the Civic Pass, ensuring the user still controls their account. This guarantees rewards go to the true account owner, not a Sybil attacker.

The refresh prompts re-verification of user identity each cycle, ensuring only active, legitimate users participate in reward programs. This stops bots, fake accounts, and inactive users from claiming rewards, keeping the system secure.

Civic offers a range of Sybil-resistant identity verification passes that work with the force refresh mechanism to ensure only real, unique users receive rewards.

* Uniqueness Pass: Combines liveness detection with additional checks to ensure each user can only create one account. After each refresh cycle, duplicate accounts are removed, ensuring a “one-user-one-account” policy.
* ID Verification Pass: Provides high-level verification using government-issued IDs, so that only verified users in high-trust, regulated communities can participate. This pass can be used with force refresh to revalidate the user's identity.

### Benefits

* Fairness: Bots and fake accounts are filtered out, and only verified users are rewarded based on real engagement.
* User Engagement: By resetting a Pass periodically, the force refresh prevents gaming of the reward system. For example, in an online forum or Web3 gaming environment, the Uniqueness Pass ensures only unique, active users can be rewarded. This not only encourages authentic participation, but also prevents low-quality contributions.
* Scalable and Secure: As communities grow, Civic’s passes scale seamlessly, providing Sybil-resistant identity verification to ensure reward systems remain fair and secure. Civic’s solutions are flexible enough to integrate into both Web2 and Web3 environments, enabling decentralized platforms to enforce identity verification directly through smart contracts.
* Trust and Safety: With Civic Passes, users know that only legitimate community members are participating in the reward system

### Use Cases

* Social Media Platform: A large or niche social media platform could use Civic’s Liveness Pass to ensure only real users earn rewards like reputation points or badges. The force refresh resets the Passes quarterly, requiring users to re-verify their identity with a quick video selfie. This process filters out bots and inactive accounts, ensuring rewards reflect recent, real activity. The result? Users trust the platform more, have more authentic interactions, and experience a significant reduction in fraudulent activity.
* DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): A DAO can Civic’s ID Verification Pass to ensure only verified members can participate in governance and receive voting tokens. The force refresh periodically revalidates members, maintaining trust within the organization and preventing manipulation through multiple accounts.
* Web3 Gaming Platform: A Web3 gaming platform might use Civic’s Uniqueness Pass to ensure each player can only have one account. During each force refresh cycle, the system resets the Passes and re-verifies active players, ensuring rewards like tokens or NFT-based achievements are distributed fairly based on real gameplay.
