# Rewards Management

## Rewards Management with Biometrics Gating for Online Communities

### Ensuring Fair and Sustainable Engagement in Digital Spaces

Online communities live and die by engagement, but managing reward systems fairly is a big challenge. Civic's rewards management solution, powered by an on-demand pass refresh mechanism, solves issues like bot-driven engagement farming, fake accounts, and low-quality participation. By periodically resetting a Uniqueness pass and verifying user identities, this solution ensures rewards are given to legitimate, active users and builds long-term trust and sustainable engagement.\


### Challenges in Online Community Reward Systems

Online communities face several challenges when managing reward systems:

* Engagement Manipulation: Bots and sock puppet accounts artificially inflate engagement metrics (likes, comments, post counts), distorting genuine participation and leading to unfair reward distribution.
* Identity Fraud: Multiple accounts created by the same user skew reward allocation and allow individuals to game the system.
* Sustainability: Maintaining authentic, long-term engagement is difficult as users might make low-quality contributions to maximize rewards. Communities need systems that encourage high-value participation over time.

### Civic's Sybil Resistance and Reward Integrity

#### Force Refresh Mechanism

Civic's force refresh feature prevents engagement manipulation by periodically resetting the Civic Pass given to the verified user, ensuring that they are still in control of their account. This ensures that rewards are given to the real beneficiaries of the account and not to a Sybil attacker.

#### How It Works

The force refresh process prompts a re-verification of user identity during each refresh cycle, ensuring that only active, legitimate users participate in reward programs. This prevents bots, sock puppets, and inactive accounts from receiving rewards, maintaining system integrity.

#### Civic Passes with Force Refresh

Civic offers a range of Sybil-resistant identity verification Passes that integrate with the force refresh mechanism to ensure only real, unique users receive rewards:

* Uniqueness Pass: Combines liveness detection with additional checks to ensure each user can only create one account. After each refresh cycle, duplicate accounts are removed, ensuring a “one-user-one-account” policy.
* ID Verification Pass: Provides high-level verification using government-issued IDs, so that only verified users in high-trust, regulated communities can participate. This pass can be used with force refresh to revalidate the user's identity and keep the system secure.

## Implementation

Civic's Passes can be integrated into existing online communities through dedicated libraries, as well as through our APIs. The force refresh feature can be configured to reset the Civic Pass at intervals defined by the community (e.g., monthly or quarterly). By embedding Civic’s identity verification tools, communities can see Sybil-resistance and fair reward distribution right away.

In decentralized communities like DAOs and Web3 gaming platforms, Civic’s passes integrate with smart contracts, enabling verified users to interact directly with the blockchain infrastructure, making the system more transparent and tamper-proof.

## Benefits of Civic's Reward Management Solution

* Fairness: Bots and fake accounts are filtered out, and only verified users are rewarded based on real engagement.
* User Engagement: By resetting a Pass periodically, the force refresh prevents gaming of the reward system. For example, in an online forum or Web3 gaming environment, the Uniqueness Pass ensures only unique, active users can be rewarded. This not only encourages authentic participation, but also prevents low-quality contributions.
* Scalable and Secure: As communities grow, Civic’s passes scale seamlessly, providing Sybil-resistant identity verification to ensure reward systems remain fair and secure. Civic’s solutions are flexible enough to integrate into both Web2 and Web3 environments, enabling decentralized platforms to enforce identity verification directly through smart contracts.
* Trust and Safety: With Civic Passes, users know that only legitimate community members are participating in the reward system

## Real-World Use Cases

* Social Media Platform: A large or niche social media platform could use Civic’s Liveness Pass to ensure only real users earn rewards like reputation points or badges. The force refresh resets the Passes quarterly, requiring users to re-verify their identity with a quick video selfie. This process filters out bots and inactive accounts, ensuring rewards reflect recent, real activity. The result? Users trust the platform more, have more authentic interactions, and experience a significant reduction in fraudulent activity.
* DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): A DAO can Civic’s ID Verification Pass to ensure only verified members can participate in governance and receive voting tokens. The force refresh periodically revalidates members, maintaining trust within the organization and preventing manipulation through multiple accounts.
* Web3 Gaming Platform: A Web3 gaming platform might use Civic’s Uniqueness Pass to ensure each player can only have one account. During each force refresh cycle, the system resets the Passes and re-verifies active players, ensuring rewards like tokens or NFT-based achievements are distributed fairly based on real gameplay.
