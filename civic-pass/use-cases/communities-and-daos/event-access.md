# Event Access

### Secure Event Access for Online Communities

Managing access to online, physical, or hybrid events can be challenging, especially in Web3 communities where decentralization is key. Our blockchain-based identity verification ensures only legitimate participants attend, maintaining privacy and preventing fraud. Itâ€™s perfect for all event types, including workshops, DAO meetings, virtual meetups, and hybrid conferences.

### Challenges in Event Access

Event organizers for online and Web3 communities face several hurdles when managing participation:

* Identity Verification: Confirming participants are unique without revealing personal data.&#x20;
* Ticket Fraud: Preventing counterfeit tickets and unauthorized access.&#x20;
* Sybil Attacks: Stopping users from creating multiple accounts to manipulate participation.
* Tiered Access: Managing different event access levels.&#x20;
* Privacy Concerns: Protecting personal data while ensuring secure identity verification.

### How Civic Can Help

* CAPTCHA Pass: A lightweight option for casual or low-security events, differentiating between humans and bots.
* Liveness Pass: Requires a video selfie for stronger verification, ensuring participants are real and present at the time of access.
* Uniqueness Pass: Combines liveness detection with other checks to ensure one-person-one-account, ideal for exclusive or high-stakes events.
