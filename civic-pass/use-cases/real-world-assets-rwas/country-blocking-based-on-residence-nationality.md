# Country Blocking Based on Residence/Nationality

### Country Blocking for RWAs

Tokenization refers to the process of converting the ownership or rights to a real-world asset, such as real estate or private equity, into a digital token that can be issued and traded on a blockchain. By tokenizing these assets, platforms enable fractional ownership, improved liquidity, and access to a global pool of investors.&#x20;

Tokenized RWAs platforms should manage access based on user nationality or residence to comply with various regulations. Country blocking based on residence or nationality is one approach that helps platforms navigate these regulations effectively when IP blocking is not enough.

### Why Block By Country?

* Compliance with Securities Regulations: Jurisdictional regulations often classify tokenized RWAs as securities, so platforms need to limit access to users from specific regions to comply with local laws.
* Adherence to Sanctions and AML Requirements: Regulations such as those from[ OFAC](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information) (U.S.) and[ AML frameworks](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-eu-level_en) in the EU may require that platforms block users from sanctioned or high-risk countries.
* Consumer Protection and Licensing: Platforms may need to restrict access for users in jurisdictions where they do not hold the necessary licenses.
* Data Privacy Compliance: Privacy laws like[ GDPR (EU)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) and[ CCPA (U.S.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) require platforms to manage personal data carefully. Some platforms may choose to block access from jurisdictions where compliance with these regulations is not feasible.

### Benefits of Blocking By Country

1. Regulatory Compliance: Only eligible users, as defined by local regulatory authorities, gain access to tokenized assets.
2. Risk Management: Platforms can protect against fraud, money laundering, and sanctions violations by blocking users from high-risk or sanctioned countries.&#x20;
3. Data Privacy Compliance: Blocking users from jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws (such as GDPR in the EU) allows platforms to avoid complex compliance requirements when they are not prepared or able to meet these standards.
4. Operational Efficiency: Country blocking reduces the need for extensive compliance infrastructure in regions where platforms do not operate.

### Use Cases

* Real Estate: Fractionalized real estate investments can be restricted based on nationality or residence to comply with securities regulations and consumer protection laws, particularly in cross-border transactions.
* Private Equity and Venture Capital: Platforms offering tokenized private equity can manage access based on compliant regions, ensuring only eligible users participate in high-risk, high-value offerings.
* High-Value Collectibles and Commodities: Country blocking helps compliance with international trade regulations for tokenized assets like art, precious metals, or luxury goods.
* Renewable Energy Projects: Investments in infrastructures such as wind or solar farms can be restricted to users from compliant jurisdictions.
* Agricultural Land and Farmland: Platforms can restrict access to comply with local laws that limit foreign ownership and investment in farmland.
* Debt Instruments and Bonds: Platforms issuing tokenized bonds can manage jurisdictional risks associated with public or municipal debt offerings.
* Carbon Credits and Environmental Assets: Manage access based on compliance with international agreements and national carbon trading regulations.
* Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs): Ensure compliance with regulations on the cross-border sale or transfer of tokenized intellectual property assets like patents and trademarks.
* Luxury Real Estate and Hospitality Ventures: Align with international investment regulations in high-value markets.

Civic Pass provides a multi-layered solution for implementing country blocking based on residence or nationality:

1. Identity Verification: Users are required to verify their identity through government-issued ID documents, which confirm their nationality or residence.
2. Tokenized Compliance: Once verified, Civic issues a blockchain-based attestation ([Civic ID Verification Pass](https://docs.civic.com/introduction/overview-of-civic-pass)) certifying the user’s eligibility based on their verified residence or nationality.
3. On-Chain Enforcement: Civic’s on-chain solution allows platforms to integrate the Civic Pass verification directly into their smart contracts, ensuring that only eligible users can execute transactions involving tokenized assets.
4. Multi-chain: Civic can be implemented on Solana and 10+ EVM-compatible chains.
