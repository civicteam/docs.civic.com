# Accredited Investor Checks

### On-Chain Accredited Investor Verification for DeFi

DeFi operators face increasing pressure to comply with regulatory requirements. While many platforms allow anyone to participate, certain opportunities—such as private placements or security token offerings—often require investors to be accredited to comply with regulations. Civic addresses this issue with a Custom Pass for Accredited Investors, offering a flexible solution that can be tailored to DeFi platforms' specific needs.

### What is an Accredited Investor

As of 2024, to[ qualify as an accredited investor under U.S. regulations](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/capital-raising-building-blocks/accredited-investors), an individual must meet one of the following criteria:

* Have an individual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 with a spouse) in each of the last two years, with the expectation of reaching the same level in the current year.
* Have a net worth of over $1 million, excluding the value of their primary residence.
* Hold professional certifications, such as the Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 licenses, which demonstrate financial expertise.

### &#x20;The Challenge for DeFi

While many DeFi platforms are open to all types of investors, those offering specific financial products—such as securities or other regulated investments—must verify accredited investor status to comply with regulatory standards. For these platforms, several challenges arise when dealing with accredited investors:

* Regulatory Compliance: For DeFi platforms looking to offer products that require accredited investor status, adhering to existing and anticipated global regulatory standards is a way to avoid legal consequences.
* Privacy Concerns: DeFi platforms champion privacy, but traditional verification methods require sensitive personal data, conflicting with privacy-first principles and making regulatory compliance challenging.
* Operational Overhead: Manual processes to verify and maintain accredited investor status are resource-intensive.
* Continuous Verification: Investor accreditation can shift, and DeFi platforms must continuously verify and update these statuses to meet ongoing compliance obligations.

### How Civic Can Help

Our Civic Custom Pass for Accredited Investors offers DeFi platforms an efficient and secure way to streamline the accredited investor verification process using blockchain technology. It's important to note that Civic does not perform the initial accredited investor checks. Instead, Civic issues passes based on the results of third-party verifications conducted by the DeFi platforms themselves. DeFi platforms may also freeze and revoke Civic Passes based on their own criteria.

·  Regulatory Compliance: The pass helps platforms meet regulatory requirements by leveraging third-party verification services so that only accredited investors access regulated financial products.

·  Privacy: Civic tokenizes investor status with a Civic Pass rather than storing sensitive personal data on-chain. This means that the accredited status is verified without revealing private financial details.

·  Operational Efficacy: By leveraging blockchain technology and integration with third-party verification services, Civic automates accreditation checks, reducing the need for manual intervention.

·  Continuous Verification: Civic's solution can help DeFi platforms ensure that investor accreditation status is updated automatically and in real-time.

Important Legal Notice: While our Custom Pass for Accredited Investors is designed to assist with accredited investor verification, DeFi platforms are ultimately responsible for ensuring their full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. We recommend that platforms using our solution also engage legal counsel to review their specific use cases and compliance needs.

### How It Works

The Civic Custom Pass for Accredited Investors process is designed to integrate seamlessly into DeFi platforms:

1. Initial Verification: DeFi platforms conduct accredited investor checks using their own chosen third-party verification services, such as[ verifyInvestor](https://www.verifyinvestor.com/accredited-investor-verification).
2. Submission to Civic: The DeFi platform submits the verification results to Civic.
3. Additional Checks: Civic may perform additional checks, such as identity verification (Liveness, Uniqueness, ID Verification) to ensure the accredited investor status matches the individual.
4. Tokenization: Upon successful verification, Civic tokenizes the investor's accredited status and issues it as a blockchain-based pass.
5. On-Chain Validation: DeFi platforms can use smart contracts to verify the validity of the pass before granting investors access to specific financial products or services.
6. Ongoing Compliance: The pass can be updated or refreshed at intervals to ensure the investor's accreditation remains valid over time.
