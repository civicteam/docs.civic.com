# On-Chain Integration

Your on-chain smart contract has to check for a valid Civic Pass during program execution and reject transaction from non-compliant users (users without an active Civic Pass).

For each blockchain supported by Civic Pass, we provide you with a library, that is tailor-made to the programming model of the chain.
