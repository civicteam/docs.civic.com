# Token Guard - Advanced gating using tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Solana Only
{% endhint %}

TokenGuard is a composable [gateway](https://docs.civic.com/) program for Solana dApps written in [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) and using CIvic Pass ([overview.md](../overview.md "mention")).

With TokenGuard, dApp developers can protect access to any dApp that accepts tokens as payment, such as a Metaplex CandyMachine mint, without requiring any on-chain smart-contract changes.

Try out our [**devnet demo on candy.civic.finance**](https://candy-tg.surge.sh/), based on [this Candy Machine UI](https://github.com/kevinfaveri/solana-candy-factory).

**NOTE**: Civic's Candy Machine fork is not yet deployed to mainnet-beta. [**Contact us on Discord** ](https://discord.gg/8H5Kdtr5Wn)if you are ready to deploy on mainnet.
