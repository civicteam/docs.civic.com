## Pass Statuses

After a Civic has been issued on-chain, the following status values may apply.

### **All Passes**

**Access Attempts from a Blocked Location**

Attempts to access the app from a blocked location (e.g., China, Russia) will be blocked and the issued Pass will be frozen.

`Pass Status is FROZEN`\
\
**Access Attempts from a Banned Location**

Attempts to access your app from a banned location (e.g., Cuba) will be blocked and the issued Pass will be revoked.

`Pass Status is REVOKED`\
\
**Pass Expiration**

CAPTCHA and Liveness: 30 days

Uniqueness: 90 days

ID Verification: On the day of government-issued ID expiration, or one year after issuance, whichever comes first.

`Pass Status is EXPIRED`

### **Uniqueness Pass**

**Pass Refresh**

Users will be required to refresh their Pass after it expires. Refreshing a Pass will happen automatically the next time the user connects to the requesting project. When connecting, Civic Pass will:

1. Request a user to sign a transaction with their wallet which will verify wallet ownership.
2. Check the userâ€™s IP address to verify that they are not located in a blocked or banned location.
3. Take a 3D FaceScan from a video selfie.
4. Match the FaceScan against the original FaceScan on the pass.

Successfully verifying wallet ownership and passing the above checks automatically reactivates a userâ€™s pass. An active Pass will remain active for 90 days after refresh unless it expires.

`Pass Status is REFRESHED / ACTIVE PASS or Pass Status is RECONNECTING / ACTIVE PASS`

\
**Active Pass Early Pass Refresh**

Each time user connects to your app with an Active Pass where the requesting project has forced a refresh, Civic Pass will:

1. Request a user to sign a transaction with their wallet which will verify wallet ownership.
2. Check the userâ€™s IP address to verify that they are not located in a blocked or banned location.
3. Re-verification depending on Pass type:
   1. **For CAPTCHA**: re-verify CAPTCHA.
   2. **For Liveness**: re-verify Liveness.
   3. **For Uniqueness or ID Verification**: Take a 3D FaceScan from a video selfie and match the FaceScan against the original FaceScan on the pass.

Successfully verifying wallet ownership and passing the above checks automatically reactivates a userâ€™s pass and updates the Pass expiration date.

`Pass Status is REFRESHED / ACTIVE PASS or Pass Status is RECONNECTING / ACTIVE PASS`

### **ID Verification Pass**

**Pass Refresh**

Users will be required to refresh their Pass after it expires. Refreshing a Pass will happen automatically the next time the user connects to the requesting project. When connecting, Civic Pass will:

1. Request a user to sign a transaction with their wallet which will verify wallet ownership.
2. Check the userâ€™s IP address to verify that they are not located in a blocked or banned location.
3. Pass biometrics re-authentication.
4. Pass government-issued ID document verification.

Successfully verifying wallet ownership, passing the IP address check, passing government-issued ID verification, as well as the biometrics verification automatically refreshes a userâ€™s Pass. An active Pass will remain active for one year after refresh unless the document expires sooner.

`Pass Status is REFRESHED / ACTIVE PASS or Pass Status is RECONNECTING / ACTIVE PASS`

\
**Reconnecting to Subscriber Property with Active Pass**

Each time a user connects to your app with an Active Pass, Civic Pass will still check the userâ€™s IP address to verify that they are not located in a blocked or banned location.

When a user connects to your app with an Active Pass, Civic will check the Biometrics refresh status to ensure the same person is using the pass.&#x20;

The Active Pass will remain active for one year after reconnecting or when document expires, whichever comes first. After one year, the pass will become inactive.

`Pass Status is REFRESHED / ACTIVE PASS or Pass Status is RECONNECTING / ACTIVE PASS`



## PII Sharing

End user must consent to share PII with the Subscriber.

Subscriber has up to 24 hours to retrieve PII after End User consents to share. End user PII will no longer be available to you from Civic after 7 days or once retrieved, whichever comes first.
