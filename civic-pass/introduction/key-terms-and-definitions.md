## Key Terms & Definitions

**Civic Pass**: A non-transferable token serving as an advanced identity and access management tool for both on-chain and off-chain applications. It enables users to verify their identity and access services securely across decentralized and traditional platforms.

**Custom Civic Pass**: A flexible, customizable identity solution that allows businesses to enforce compliance rules on-chain. Custom Civic Passes can be tailored to specific business needs using the Tenant Network.

**Gateway Provider**: A React component managing Civic Pass integration. It simplifies the process of integrating the Global Network, allowing Civic to handle user verification and issuance of the Civic Pass.

**Gatekeeper Network**: The network responsible for issuing and managing Civic Passes. Each Gatekeeper Network has a unique address, with specific rules and criteria for pass issuance and verification.

**Network Key**: A unique identifier that grants access to a specific Gatekeeper Network. This key is required to access Civicâ€™s Global Network and ensures that the rules of the Gatekeeper Network are followed during integration.

**Attestation**: A verified claim about a user's identity or attributes issued by a trusted party within the Gatekeeper Network. These claims are used to verify identity or other necessary information.

**Verifiable Credentials**: Cryptographically secured digital credentials that represent a userâ€™s attributes or qualifications. They can be used to verify identity or compliance without revealing sensitive personal information.

**Verification Process**: This includes CAPTCHA, Liveness, Uniqueness, and ID Verification, which confirm a userâ€™s identity according to set criteria. These checks ensure users meet the standards set by the Gatekeeper Provider and Gatekeeper Network for Civic Pass issuance.

**Tokenized Identity**: A digital representation of identity information stored on a blockchain, ensuring the integrity and security of identity attributes. Civic Pass serves as a tokenized identity that can be used across decentralized platforms.

**On-chain/Off-chain**: Refers to whether data or processes occur directly on the blockchain (on-chain) or through external systems (off-chain). Civic Pass can be used in both types of environments depending on the application's requirements.

## Integration Concepts

**React Component**: This is the way you can trigger verification flows directly in your app. Projects using this method rely on Civic to handle the entire user verification and Civic Pass issuance process.&#x20;

**API**: This method allows customers to directly manage the verification process and the issuance of Civic Passes to their users. This is only applicable to Custom Passes.

## Fees & Costs

**Blockchain Fees**: Transaction costs associated with interacting with a blockchain network for pass issuance, verification, or other related processes.

**Pass Fees**: Costs associated with issuing and maintaining Civic Passes, including fees for verification and pass renewal. These fees depend on the specific Gatekeeper Network or service provider.

**User-Pay Model**: In some cases, certain features or networks operate on a user-pays basis, where the user is responsible for covering the costs of verification.
