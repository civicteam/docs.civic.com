  <Card title="See How It Works" icon="circle-question">
  [Get a Civic Pass to see how it works](https://getpass.civic.com/?scope=liveness,uniqueness,captcha). We recommend using testnet/devnet and starting with CAPTCHA Pass or Liveness Pass. Youâ€™ll need to have some testnet/devnet funds in your wallet to complete the process.

## Integration Options

Civic offers three integration components for maximum composability:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Frontend Libraries" icon="code">
  This is first step towards integrating the Civic Pass verification flow into your app.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend Libraries" icon="server">
  This is for accessing pass state through your backend infrastructure to complement the Frontend integration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-chain Smart Contracts" icon="code-branch">
  For blockchain-based applications requiring decentralized verification at blockchain level. This can replace the Backend libraries integration, but does still require a Frontend integration.

## Deploy in Minutes

Navigate to your blockchain of choice in the index for tailored instructions on how to integrate Civic on different chains.

### EVMs

Install the Civic Gateway library for your chain.

```bash
npm i @civic/ethereum-gateway-react@latest
```

Next, import and configure the GatewayProvider component.

```tsx
import { GatewayProvider } from "@civic/ethereum-gateway-react";

<GatewayProvider
  wallet={wallet}
  gatekeeperNetwork={gatekeeperNetwork}>
  {children}
</GatewayProvider>
```

<Info>
  Children wrapped by the `GatewayProvider` will have access to the connected wallet's Civic Pass. We recommend using the **Identity Button** to retrieve pass state and we suggest placing the `<GatewayProvider>` as high up in the component tree as possible to ensure you have access to the Civic Pass state throughout your dApp.
</Info>
### Solana

Install the Civic Gateway library for your chain.

```bash
npm i @civic/solana-gateway-react@latest
```

Next, import and configure the GatewayProvider component.

```tsx
import { GatewayProvider } from "@civic/solana-gateway-react";
import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js';

<GatewayProvider
  connection={new Connection( /*your RPC endpoint*/, "confirmed")}
  wallet={wallet}
  gatekeeperNetwork={gatekeeperNetwork}>
  {children}
</GatewayProvider>
```

<Info>
  Children wrapped by the`GatewayProvider` will have access to the connected wallet's Civic Pass.
</Info>

We recommend using the provided **Identity Button** to retrieve pass state and we suggest placing the `<GatewayProvider>` as high up in the component tree as possible to ensure you have access to the Civic Pass state throughout your dApp. Find out more in the integration guide for your chain.
