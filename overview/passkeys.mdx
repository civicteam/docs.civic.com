Passkeys provide a seamless user experience and enhanced security. Instead of typing a password, users authenticate through simple, secure actions such as:
- A biometric scan (fingerprint, Face ID) or device PIN
- Tapping a physical security key (e.g., YubiKey)
- Authenticating via a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden)

## How to Enable Passkeys

To enable passkeys for your app:

1. Navigate to your [Civic Auth Dashboard](https://auth.civic.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Application Options** in the sidebar
3. Find the **Enable passkeys** section
4. Toggle the passkey setting to **ON**
5. Configure how often users should be prompted to create a passkey

You can also decide how often you'd like your users to be prompted to create a passkey, based either on the number of logins or the time since their last login.

## User Experience

When passkeys are enabled, here's what your users will experience:

1. **First-time setup**: After logging in with email or social login, users will be prompted to create a passkey for faster future access
2. **Subsequent logins**: Users can choose to authenticate with their passkey for instant access
3. **Fallback options**: Users can always skip passkey authentication and use traditional login methods instead

<Note>Due to browser iframe security restrictions, passkey authentication requires users to go through the full-page authentication flow rather than authenticating within an iframe.</Note>

## Technical Implementation

Passkeys are built on the [WebAuthn standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/), providing cryptographic security that eliminates many common attack vectors associated with traditional passwords. No additional code changes are required in your application - Civic Auth handles all the passkey implementation automatically.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Built on the WebAuthn standard, passkeys are strongly resistant to phishing and server-side data breaches
- **Effortless Experience**: No need to create, remember, or type complex passwords
- **Cross-Device Syncing**: Passkeys sync across devices through platform accounts (Apple ID, Google Account)
- **Faster Logins**: Quick authentication without typing credentials
