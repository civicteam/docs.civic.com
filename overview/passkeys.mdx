Passkeys offer a secure and passwordless replacement for traditional passwords. They provide enhanced security while delivering a seamless user experience through biometric authentication, device PINs, or security keys.

## How to Enable Passkeys

To enable passkeys for your app:

1. Navigate to your [Civic Auth Dashboard](https://auth.civic.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Application Options** in the sidebar
3. Find the **Enable passkeys** section
4. Toggle the passkey setting to **ON**
5. Configure when users should be prompted to create passkeys

### Prompt Frequency Options

You can also decide how often you'd like your users to be prompted to create a passkey, based either on the number of logins or the time since their last login.

## What are Passkeys?

Instead of typing a password, users authenticate through simple, secure actions such as:
- A biometric scan (fingerprint, Face ID) or device PIN
- Tapping a physical security key (e.g., YubiKey) 
- Authenticating via a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden)

## Authentication Flow

Passkeys provide **inherent multi-factor authentication (MFA)** by combining multiple authentication factors in a single step:
- **Something you have**: The device storing the passkey
- **Something you are/know**: Biometric verification (fingerprint/face) or device PIN

Users can:
- Use passkeys to bypass email/social login steps for faster access
- Always fall back to traditional login methods
- Continue using their preferred primary authentication method if they don't have their passkey

This flexibility ensures users never get locked out while providing enhanced security through built-in MFA.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Built on the WebAuthn standard, passkeys are strongly resistant to phishing and server-side data breaches
- **Effortless Experience**: No need to create, remember, or type complex passwords
- **Cross-Device Syncing**: Passkeys sync across devices through platform accounts (Apple ID, Google Account)
- **Faster Logins**: Quick authentication without typing credentials
- **Built-in MFA**: Inherent multi-factor authentication without additional steps

## User Experience

When passkeys are enabled, here's what your users will experience:

1. **First-time setup**: After logging in with email or social login, users will be prompted to create a passkey for faster future access
2. **Subsequent logins**: Users can choose to authenticate with their passkey for instant access
3. **Fallback options**: Users can always skip passkey authentication and use traditional login methods instead

## Browser Compatibility

For current browser support and compatibility matrices:
- **[WebAuthn API Browser Compatibility](https://caniuse.com/webauthn)** - Live compatibility data for WebAuthn support
- **[Passkeys.dev Device Support](https://passkeys.dev/device-support/)** - Detailed passkey support by platform and browser
- **[FIDO Alliance Certified Products](https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/)** - List of certified authenticators

### Key Compatibility Resources
- **[MDN WebAuthn API Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API)** - Comprehensive API reference with browser notes
- **[WebAuthn.io](https://webauthn.io/)** - Interactive demo to test passkey support in your current browser
- **[Passkeys.dev](https://passkeys.dev/)** - Developer resources and implementation guides

### Important Implementation Notes

**Cross-platform syncing:**
- Apple passkeys sync via iCloud Keychain (Apple ecosystem only)
- Google passkeys sync via Google Password Manager (Chrome/Android)
- Windows Hello passkeys are typically device-bound
- See [Passkeys.dev Syncing Guide](https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#synced-passkeys) for detailed sync behavior


**No additional code changes are required** in your application - Civic Auth handles all the passkey implementation automatically, including:
- WebAuthn credential creation and verification
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Fallback handling
- Error management

Your application continues to receive the same user authentication tokens regardless of whether the user logged in with a passkey or traditional method.
