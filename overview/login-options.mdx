You can choose different Login Options for your App using the [Civic Auth Dashboard](https://auth.civic.com/dashboard). You can choose which providers you'd like to support, and the order you'd like to present them to your users.

Just click on a provider icon to enable or disable it, and drag the option above or below existing options to change the ordering. As soon as you make an update, you'll see a preview of what your users will see.

## Social Providers (OAuth)

We currently support the following social providers:
- Google
- Discord
- Github
- Facebook
- X
- Apple
- Microsoft (coming soon)

Don't see your preferred provider? [Let us know](https://join.slack.com/t/civic-developers/shared_invite/zt-37tv9fyo7-aDT43mUjOFQwdQFmfZLTRw) and we'll see what we can do!

## Email

Users login by proving ownership of their email address by entering an OTP (One-Time PIN) sent to their email.

## Account linking

When a user logs in using an email address, once the OTP code is verified, we check if the email has already been used with a Google or Apple account.

If the email address associated with one of these providers matches the email address used to login, we automatically link the accounts. This means that the returned user id will be the same for both login methods, and the user's profile information will be merged, i.e. their name, profile picture, and any other relevant information.

## Passkeys

Passkeys offer a secure and passwordless replacement for traditional passwords. They provide enhanced security while delivering a seamless user experience.

### What are Passkeys?

Instead of typing a password, users authenticate through simple, secure actions such as:
- A biometric scan (fingerprint, Face ID) or device PIN
- Tapping a physical security key (e.g., YubiKey) 
- Authenticating via a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden)

### Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Built on the WebAuthn standard, passkeys are strongly resistant to phishing and server-side data breaches
- **Effortless Experience**: No need to create, remember, or type complex passwords
- **Cross-Device Syncing**: Passkeys sync across devices through platform accounts (Apple ID, Google Account)
- **Faster Logins**: Quick authentication without typing credentials

### How to Enable Passkeys

To enable passkeys for your app:

1. Navigate to your [Civic Auth Dashboard](https://auth.civic.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Application Options** in the sidebar
3. Find the **Enable passkeys** section
4. Toggle the passkey setting to **ON**
5. Configure how often users should be prompted to create a passkey

</Frame>

You can also decide how often you'd like your users to be prompted to create a passkey, based either on the number of logins or the time since their last login.

### User Experience

When passkeys are enabled, here's what your users will experience:

1. **First-time setup**: After logging in with email or social login, users will be prompted to create a passkey for faster future access
2. **Subsequent logins**: Users can choose to authenticate with their passkey for instant access
3. **Fallback options**: Users can always skip passkey authentication and use traditional login methods instead

<Note>Due to browser iframe security restrictions, passkey authentication requires users to go through the full-page authentication flow rather than authenticating within an iframe.</Note>

### Technical Implementation

Passkeys are built on the [WebAuthn standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/), providing cryptographic security that eliminates many common attack vectors associated with traditional passwords. No additional code changes are required in your application - Civic Auth handles all the passkey implementation automatically.
