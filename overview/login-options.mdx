You can choose different Login Options for your App using the [Civic Auth Dashboard](https://auth.civic.com/dashboard). You can choose which providers you'd like to support, and the order you'd like to present them to your users.

Just click on a provider icon to enable or disable it, and drag the option above or below existing options to change the ordering. As soon as you make an update, you'll see a preview of what your users will see.

## Social Providers (OAuth)

We currently support the following social providers:
- Google
- Discord
- Github
- Facebook
- X
- Apple
- Microsoft (coming soon)

Don't see your preferred provider? [Let us know](https://join.slack.com/t/civic-developers/shared_invite/zt-37tv9fyo7-aDT43mUjOFQwdQFmfZLTRw) and we'll see what we can do!

## Email

Users login by proving ownership of their email address by entering an OTP (One-Time PIN) sent to their email.

## Account linking

When a user logs in using an email address, once the OTP code is verified, we check if the email has already been used with a Google or Apple account.

If the email address associated with one of these providers matches the email address used to login, we automatically link the accounts. This means that the returned user id will be the same for both login methods, and the user's profile information will be merged, i.e. their name, profile picture, and any other relevant information.

## Passkey

Passkeys are a modern, passwordless way for your users to sign in to your website or app using their device's built-in security features like fingerprint, face scan, or PIN. Instead of remembering complex passwords, users simply verify their identity with the same method they use to unlock their phone or computer. They're more secure than passwords because they can't be phished, guessed, or stolen in data breaches, and they work seamlessly across all devices when synced through the platform's account (like iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager).

To enable the creation and usage of passkeys for your app, go to Application Options and toggle the "Enable Passkeys" setting. You can also decide how often you'd like your users to be prompted to create a passkey, based either on the number of logins or the time since their last login.

When passkeys are enabled, users will see an option to create a passkey during the login process, after they have logged in with one of the existing login methods like email or social login. If they choose to create one, they will be prompted to authenticate using their device's security features. Once created, users can log in using their passkey instead of entering a password or OTP, and they will be prompted to use passkey on subsequent visits to your website. They will always have the option of canceling the passkey login and instead using a different login method.

If they choose not to create a passkey, they will still be logged in as usual and can continue using their existing login methods.

If you toggle the "Enable Passkeys" setting off, users won't be prompted to use their existing passkey but will still be able to log in using their email or social login methods. If you toggle "Enable Passkeys" back on, users can use their previously-created passkeys.
