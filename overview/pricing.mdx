You won't see any surprises when building with **Civic Auth**.

Our pricing is simple and transparent, made to help builders focus on their product early on and not worry about complex policies as you scale.

You only pay for active users that add value to your application — and that's only **after you exceed 15,000 MAUs** for Auth only. For web3 apps with embedded wallets, you get **15,000 MAUs for users without wallets** AND **2,000 MAUs for users with wallets**.

<Note>
**How MAU limits work for web3 apps:**

Web3 apps with embedded wallets get BOTH limits:
- **15,000 MAUs** for users who authenticate without creating a wallet
- **2,000 MAUs** for users who create wallets

After reaching 2,000 users with wallets, new wallet creations will be throttled, but users without wallets can still authenticate as long as the 15,000 MAU limit is not exceeded.
