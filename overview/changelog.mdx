<Update label="July 14th, 2025" description="Enterprise Security & Mobile Excellence" tags={["Authentication", "Mobile", "Bug Fixes"]}>

🔐 **Client secrets for the enterprise crowd**
Your enterprise customers have been asking for it, and we delivered! Client secret authentication is now fully supported for confidential client applications. You can choose between PKCE + client secret for maximum security, or client secret only for legacy systems. This brings the enhanced security that large organizations need when integrating Civic Auth into their mission-critical systems.

📱 **Mobile-first login experience**
We've completely overhauled the mobile login experience. Provider buttons now display beautifully on all screen sizes, loading times are lightning-fast, and everything just... works. No more squinting at tiny buttons or waiting for providers to load!

🛠️ **Universal JavaScript support**
Whether you're using Express, Fastify, Hono, or building your own custom backend - our enhanced vanilla JavaScript SDK now works seamlessly with any framework. One SDK to rule them all!

🐛 **Spring cleaning for stability**
We've been busy with our bug spray! Fixed those pesky login app loading issues during redirects, eliminated duplicate accounts in the Customer Dashboard, resolved mobile logo pixelation (crisp logos for everyone!), and made Apple authentication much more graceful when users decide to cancel.

<Update label="June 5th, 2025" description="Going Native & Vanilla" tags={["SDKs", "Mobile", "JavaScript"]}>

📱 **React Native support has arrived!**
iOS and Android developers, this one's for you! Civic Auth now fully supports React Native applications with native mobile optimization. Build once, authenticate everywhere - with the performance your users expect.

🍦 **Pure vanilla JavaScript goodness**
Sometimes you don't need a framework - you just need authentication that works. Our pure JavaScript implementation is perfect for those "keep it simple" projects where you want full control without the framework overhead.

<Update label="June 3rd, 2025" description="¡Hola mundo! Guten Tag authentication!" tags={["Localization", "Enhancement"]}>

🌍 **Breaking language barriers**
¡Hablamos español! Wir sprechen Deutsch! Our login flow now speaks Spanish and German fluently, making authentication feel native for your international users. Complete translations, cultural considerations - the works.

📸 **Picture perfect profiles**
Google profile pictures were having some... let's call them "rendering challenges." We've implemented smart caching that eliminates those awkward moments when profile pics fail to load. Your users' beautiful faces deserve better!

Our billing dashboard was showing some creative interpretations of monthly data. We've brought it back to reality with accurate chart displays that actually reflect your usage patterns.

🎯 **Less noise, more signal**
App banners were getting a bit chatty in development environments. We've taught them to speak only when it matters - production apps only. Your dev workflow just got quieter.
