<Update label="August 6th, 2025" description="React Frontend + Any Backend Support" tags={["React", "SDK", "Enhancement"]}>

🔗 **Mix and match React with any backend**
New React SDK feature lets you use React on the frontend with any backend technology. Whether you're running Node.js, Python, Go, or something else entirely, our React components now work seamlessly with your existing auth setup.

Perfect for teams that want React's user experience with the flexibility to choose their backend stack.

<Update label="July 30th, 2025" description="Auth Middleware Improvements & Session Management" tags={["Middleware", "Sessions", "Bug Fixes"]}>

⚡ **Smarter auth middleware**
Refactored authentication middleware with better utilities and improved token refresh prioritization. Sessions now handle cleanup and replenishment more reliably.

🛠️ **URL parameter cleanup**
Fixed issues with code parameter handling and improved session cleanup processes. Login flows are now more robust across different scenarios.

🔧 **Enhanced session reliability**
Better session management ensures users stay authenticated properly and reduces unexpected logouts during normal usage.

<Update label="July 14th, 2025" description="Enterprise Security & Mobile Excellence" tags={["Authentication", "Mobile", "Bug Fixes"]}>

🔐 **Client secrets for the enterprise crowd**
We kept hearing from enterprise customers that they needed client secrets for their confidential applications. So we built it. You can now choose PKCE + client secret for maximum security, or go with client secrets only if you're working with legacy systems that need it.

Check out our [authentication flows guide](/overview/authentication-flows) to see how it works.

📱 **Mobile login that actually works**
Remember those tiny login buttons that were impossible to tap on mobile? Yeah, we fixed that. Login buttons now look good and load fast on phones. No more squinting at your screen trying to hit the right spot.

🛠️ **Vanilla JavaScript plays nice with everything**
Our vanilla JavaScript integration now works smoothly with Express, Fastify, Hono, or whatever backend you're running. Same simple code, any framework.

🐛 **Bug fixes and improvements**
We've been busy polishing the experience:
- Various login flow improvements
- Enhanced mobile display quality
- Better handling of edge cases across different auth methods
