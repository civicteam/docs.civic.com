This allows Civic Auth apps to provide their users with access to the world of Cryptocurrencies and Web3 without any hassle or prior knowledge."

<Info>
Currently, we don't support connecting users' existing self-custodial wallets. This is coming soon.

Right now, we only support embedded wallets, which are generated on behalf of the user by our non-custodial wallet partner. Neither Civic nor your app ever has access to the wallets' private keys.

## Quick Start

Sign up for Civic Auth at [auth.civic.com](https://auth.civic.com) and make sure to select the "Web3 wallet" option.

## About Embedded Wallets

### What are Embedded Wallets?

Embedded wallets are cryptocurrency wallets provided directly by an app or website, rather than requiring the user to supply their own.

This approach is a powerful tool for onboarding non-crypto users into Web3, enabling apps to cater to both crypto-native users and newcomers alike.

By removing the need for complicated wallet setup, remembering seed phrases etc., embedded wallets are a vital tool for bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3.

### Civic's Embedded Wallets

The Civic Embedded Wallet Service is non-custodial, meaning neither Civic nor Civic's customers have control over users’ wallets or assets.

Each wallet is linked to a user’s SSO (Single Sign-On) provider, such as Google, ensuring that only authenticated users can sign transactions.

Civic's wallets are EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallets, rather than smart contract (AKA account abstraction) wallets. This has benefits in terms of simplicity and lower gas costs. However, they can be upgraded to support account abstraction, for example to support gas sponsorship. Contact Civic at [support@civic.com](mailto:support@civic.com) if you're interested in this feature.

### **Recovery**

Our wallet provider includes a recovery feature, ensuring that funds are not lost in case of a service interruption with Civic.

For more details on the security and recovery features of Civic wallets, please refer to the documentation provided by our service provider.
