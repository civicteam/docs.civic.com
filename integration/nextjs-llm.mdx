Use these prompts with your LLM (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT) to automate Civic Auth integration into your Next.js project. Choose the prompt that matches your requirements.

## Next.js with Web3

<Info>
Use this prompt if you want to integrate Civic Auth with Web3 wallet support (embedded wallets, EVM, Solana, etc.).

# Civic Auth Integration Prompt: Next.js with Web3

## Prerequisites
- Obtain a Civic Auth Client ID from https://auth.civic.com
- Make sure your project uses Next.js 14.2.25 or 15.2.3+

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication with Web3 support to this Next.js application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/nextjs-implementation.md

## Project Context
- **Client ID**: [PROVIDE YOUR CLIENT ID HERE]
- **Web3 Required**: Yes

## Step 2: Implementation Plan
- Analyze the project structure
- Use @civic/auth-web3/nextjs and related imports
- Follow the documentation for Web3 integration

## Step 3: Implement Civic Auth
- Use ONLY the documentation fetched via curl
- Adapt all code examples for Web3 (use @civic/auth-web3/nextjs, @civic/auth-web3/react, etc.)
- Ensure middleware and API routes use the correct imports

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Middleware Placement
**In Next.js App Router projects, the middleware.ts file MUST be placed in the project root, at the same level as the app/ directory.**

- Do NOT place middleware.ts inside the src/ directory or any subdirectory
- If you do, the middleware will NOT run and authentication will not work

**Before creating middleware.ts:**
- Check the project structure
- If there is an app/ directory, place middleware.ts in the same directory as app/ (the project root)
- If you see both src/ and app/ directories, make sure middleware.ts is NOT inside src/

**Example structure:**
```
my-nextjs-project/
  app/
    ...
  middleware.ts   <-- MUST be here, not in src/
  src/
    ...
```

## Important Notes
- Do NOT use @civic/auth/nextjs or @civic/auth/react for Web3 integration
- Place middleware.ts in the project root (same level as app/)
- If authentication does not work, check the middleware location first
- Verify middleware.ts is at the correct level in the project structure
```

## Next.js without Web3

<Info>
Use this prompt if you want to integrate Civic Auth without Web3 wallet support.

# Civic Auth Integration Prompt: Next.js without Web3

## Prerequisites
- Obtain a Civic Auth Client ID from https://auth.civic.com
- Make sure your project uses Next.js 14.2.25 or 15.2.3+

## Task
Add Civic Auth authentication (no Web3) to this Next.js application.

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation
Use curl to fetch the Civic Auth documentation:

curl https://docs.civic.com/integration/nextjs-implementation.md

## Project Context
- **Client ID**: [PROVIDE YOUR CLIENT ID HERE]
- **Web3 Required**: No

## Step 2: Implementation Plan
- Analyze the project structure
- Use @civic/auth/nextjs and related imports
- Follow the documentation for standard integration

## Step 3: Implement Civic Auth
- Use ONLY the documentation fetched via curl
- Adapt all code examples for standard integration (use @civic/auth/nextjs, @civic/auth/react, etc.)
- Ensure middleware and API routes use the correct imports
