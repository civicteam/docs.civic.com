The core integration points here are as follows:

* Direct users to the Civic Auth login page

* Set up an endpoint that the auth server should redirect to once complete

* Set up middleware to ensure only logged-in users can access protected parts of your app.

Use these guides to set up Civic Auth with any of the most common Node.js server libraries.

## Usage

Civic Auth SDK is optimized for React and Next.js. However, some features are usable in other JS environments. For example, the `getUser` function verifies and parses the user information stored in the id\_token cookie and makes it available to your app.

### Getting User Information on the Backend

Here are some examples of using the getUser function in popular Node.JS server environments. Note - this snippet assumes you have followed the steps to integrate login with your app as described [here](/integration/nodejs).
You have to provide a class that tells Civic how to load and store cookies, by implementing the CookieStorage interface.
We provide examples for [Express](https://docs.civic.com/integration/nodejs/express#4-set-up-cookies), [Hono](https://docs.civic.com/integration/nodejs/hono#4-set-up-cookies) and [Fastify](https://docs.civic.com/integration/nodejs/fastify#4-set-up-cookies).

  ```express Express
  import { CivicAuth } from "@civic/auth/server";

  app.get('/admin/hello', async (req, res) => {
    // You need to provide a class implementing the CookieStorage interface,
    // telling Civic how to load and store cookies.
    // See the Express page for an example:
    // https://docs.civic.com/integration/nodejs/express#4-set-up-cookies

    const yourCookieStorageInstance = new ExpressCookieStorage();
    const civicAuth = new CivicAuth(yourCookieStorageInstance);
    const user = await civicAuth.getUser();
    res.send(`hello ${user.name}!`);
  });
  ```

  ```hono Hono
  import { CivicAuth } from "@civic/auth/server";

  app.get('/admin/hello', async (c) => {
    // You need to provide a class implementing the CookieStorage interface,
    // telling Civic how to load and store cookies.
    // See the Hono page for an example:
    // https://docs.civic.com/integration/nodejs/hono#4-set-up-cookies

    const yourCookieStorageInstance = new HonoCookieStorage();
    const civicAuth = new CivicAuth(yourCookieStorageInstance);
    const user = await civicAuth.getUser();
    return c.text(`hello ${user.name}!`);
  });
  ```

  ```fastify Fastify
   import { CivicAuth } from "@civic/auth/server";

  fastify.get('/admin/hello', async (request, reply) => {
    // You need to provide a class implementing the CookieStorage interface,
    // telling Civic how to load and store cookies.
    // See the Fastify page for an example:
    // https://docs.civic.com/integration/nodejs/fastify#4-set-up-cookies

    const yourCookieStorageInstance = new FastifyCookieStorage();
    const civicAuth = new CivicAuth(yourCookieStorageInstance);
    const user = await civicAuth.getUser();
    reply.send(`hello ${user.name}!`);
  });
  ```

<Info>
  The `name` property is used as an example here, check out the [React Usage page](/integration/react#usage) to see the entire basic user object structure.
