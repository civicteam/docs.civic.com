You won't see any surprises when building with **Civic Auth**.
Our pricing is simple and transparent, made to help builders focus on their
product early on and not worry about complex policies as you scale.
You only pay for active users that add value to your application â€” and that's
only **after you exceed 15,000 MAUs**.
