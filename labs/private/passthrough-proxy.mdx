title: Pass-through Proxy
description: Implementation details for Pass-through Proxy
---

## Overview

The Pass-through Proxy is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a middleware layer between AI assistants and MCP tools. It enables you to intercept, validate, modify, and monitor all tool interactions through a flexible hook system.

## Why Use Pass-through Proxy?

For a detailed explanation of why MCP needs hooks, see the repository README which explains the core concepts.

### Key Benefits

1. **Security & Validation** - Add security checks without modifying the original MCP servers
2. **Audit & Compliance** - Log all AI tool interactions for compliance and debugging
3. **Context-Aware Modifications** - Transform requests based on user context or environment
4. **Rate Limiting** - Protect your tools from excessive usage
5. **A/B Testing** - Route requests to different backends based on rules

### Common Use Cases

- **Guardrails for File Access**: Limit which directories an AI can access
- **API Key Injection**: Add authentication tokens to requests automatically
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which tools are used most frequently
- **Content Filtering**: Block sensitive data from being exposed
- **Request Transformation**: Modify tool parameters based on user permissions

## Getting Started

### Installation

The Pass-through Proxy is available as an npm package:

```bash
npm install -g @civic/passthrough-mcp-server
```

### Basic Setup

1. **Identify your target MCP server** - The server you want to add middleware to
2. **Choose or create hooks** - Pre-built hooks are available, or create custom ones
3. **Configure and run** - Set environment variables and start the proxy

For a complete getting started guide, see [Getting Started](https://github.com/civicteam/mcp-tools#getting-started) in the repository.

### Configuration

Configure via environment variables:

- `PORT` - Where the proxy listens (default: 34000)
- `TARGET_SERVER_URL` - The MCP server to forward requests to
- `HOOKS` - Comma-separated URLs of hook servers


Example:
```bash
export TARGET_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3000"
export HOOKS="http://localhost:33004,http://localhost:33005"
pnpm start
```

## Available Hooks

The monorepo includes several pre-built hooks. See [Available Packages](https://github.com/civicteam/mcp-tools#available-packages) for the complete list:

### Audit Hook
Logs every request and response for debugging and compliance. Perfect for understanding what your AI is doing.

### Guardrail Hook
Implements security rules to filter and validate requests. Includes domain filtering and content restrictions.

### Rate Limit Hook
Enforces usage limits per user with configurable windows and clear retry-after responses.

### Explain Hook
Adds a "reason" parameter to all tools, encouraging transparency in AI tool usage.

### Custom Description Hook
Modifies tool descriptions based on context, useful for environment-specific guidance.

## Creating Custom Hooks

Hooks implement a simple interface with three possible responses:

1. **Continue** - Allow the request (possibly modified)
2. **Reject** - Block the request with an error
3. **Respond** - Return a response without calling the target

For detailed implementation examples, see [Creating Your Own Hook](https://github.com/civicteam/mcp-tools#creating-your-own-hook) in the repository.

## Integration Patterns

### With MCP Hub
Use Pass-through Proxy as middleware in the MCP Hub to apply consistent policies across all tools.

### With Claude Desktop
Add hooks to any MCP server used by Claude Desktop by configuring the proxy as an intermediary.

### In Production
Deploy hooks as separate microservices for scalability and independent updates.

## Architecture

The proxy uses:
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** for the server implementation
- **tRPC** for type-safe hook communication

Hook processing follows a pipeline pattern:
- Requests flow through hooks in order
- Responses flow back in reverse order
- Any hook can short-circuit the pipeline
