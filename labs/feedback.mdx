- Pushes boundaries of what's possible
- Can start small and grow
- Benefits from community input

### How to Propose

2. Include:
   - Problem it solves
   - Potential approach
   - Why it needs experimentation
   - How others could benefit

## ü§ù Contribute

### Code Contributions
While most repos are private during early development:
1. [Request contributor access](https://civickey.typeform.com/to/uVH7CWJ5)
2. Review our contribution guidelines
3. Start with small PRs
4. Focus on documentation and examples

### Non-Code Contributions
Equally valuable ways to contribute:
- **Documentation**: Improve guides and examples
- **Testing**: Try tools and report experiences
- **Use Cases**: Share how you're using Labs tools
- **Community**: Help others in Discord
- **Advocacy**: Spread the word about cool experiments

Remember: Civic Labs is about exploration. Not every experiment succeeds, but every insight helps us build better tools for the community.
