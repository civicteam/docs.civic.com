Civic Labs thrives on community input. Whether you're using our tools, have ideas for new experiments, or want to contribute code, we want to hear from you.

## üí¨ Join the Conversation

### Discord Community
Our most active community channel for real-time discussion:
- Get help with integration
- Share your use cases
- Discuss feature ideas
- Connect with other builders

[Join Civic Discord ‚Üí](https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8)

### GitHub Discussions
For more structured feedback and feature requests:
- Propose new flask ideas
- Discuss architectural decisions
- Share integration patterns
- Report issues

*Note: Most repos are currently private. Request access first.*

## üêõ Report Issues

Found a bug or security issue?

### Standard Issues
1. Check if it's already reported in GitHub Issues
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details

### Security Issues
For security vulnerabilities:
- **DO NOT** create public issues
- Email: security@civicteam.com
- Use our PGP key for sensitive reports
- We aim to respond within 48 hours

## üí° Suggest New Flasks

Have an idea for a new experiment? We'd love to hear it!

### What Makes a Good Flask Idea?
- Solves a real problem in AI/identity space
- Pushes boundaries of what's possible
- Can start small and grow
- Benefits from community input

### How to Propose
1. Start a discussion in Discord or GitHub
2. Include:
   - Problem it solves
   - Potential approach
   - Why it needs experimentation
   - How others could benefit

## ü§ù Contribute

### Code Contributions
While most repos are private during early development:
1. Request contributor access
2. Review our contribution guidelines
3. Start with small PRs
4. Focus on documentation and examples

### Non-Code Contributions
Equally valuable ways to contribute:
- **Documentation**: Improve guides and examples
- **Testing**: Try tools and report experiences
- **Use Cases**: Share how you're using Labs tools
- **Community**: Help others in Discord
- **Advocacy**: Spread the word about cool experiments

## üìÆ Direct Contact

For partnership, investment, or other inquiries:

- **General**: labs@civicteam.com
- **Partnerships**: partnerships@civicteam.com
- **Security**: security@civicteam.com

## üéØ Current Priorities

We're especially interested in feedback on:

1. **MCP Integration Patterns**: How are you connecting AI to tools?
2. **Security Requirements**: What threats concern you most?
3. **Auth Workflows**: How should AI handle user permissions?
4. **Developer Experience**: What would make integration easier?

## üèÜ Recognition

We believe in recognizing community contributions:
- Contributors list in repos
- Shoutouts in release notes
- Early access to new flasks
- Civic Labs swag for significant contributions

## üìù Feedback Guidelines

To help us help you:

### Do
- Be specific about your use case
- Include examples when possible
- Suggest solutions, not just problems
- Be patient - we're experimenting!

### Don't
- Share private keys or credentials
- Post security vulnerabilities publicly
- Expect production SLAs on experiments
- Be discouraged if ideas pivot

## What Happens Next?

When you share feedback:
1. We'll acknowledge receipt quickly
2. Discuss internally and with community
3. Provide updates on implementation
4. Credit you when we ship features

Remember: Civic Labs is about exploration. Not every experiment succeeds, but every insight helps us build better tools for the community.
