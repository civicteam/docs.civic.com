description: LLM-based threat detection for prompts and tool calls

**Flask Status: Distilling** ðŸ§ª

## Overview

Bodyguard is a security analysis service that detects malicious prompts and potential attacks in LLM inputs.
It identifies prompt injection attacks, social engineering attempts,
and other security threats before they can reach your AI systems or tools.
Each prompt receives a threat score from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates extreme risk,
and a set of findings, that can aid decision-making.

Unlike rule-based security systems, Bodyguard uses an LLM to understand the semantic intent behind prompts,
catching sophisticated attacks that might bypass traditional filters.

## Getting Started

Try it out [here](https://ai.civic.com/bodyguard/ui) (COMING SOON) or see [below](/labs/projects/bodyguard#usage) for detailed instructions.

## Use Cases

- End-user-facing chatbots, help-bots, etc
- Automatic email readers/responders
- Automatic processors of any untrusted input
- Twitterbots, Discord bots, or any other social media automation

## Key Features

![Bodyguard](/images/labs/projects/bodyguard/bodyguard-summary.png)

- **Prompt Injection Detection**: Identifies attempts to override system prompts or instructions
- **Information Extraction Prevention**: Catches attempts to extract sensitive data or system information
- **Malicious Function Call Detection**: Recognizes dangerous tool-calling patterns
- **Social Engineering Defense**: Detects manipulation tactics and deceptive requests
- **Threat Scoring**: Provides numerical threat scores (0-1) for risk assessment
- **Multiple Deployment Options**: Available as CLI tool, HTTP server, and client library

## Usage

Bodyguard can be integrated in three ways:

### 1. HTTP Server
Deploy Bodyguard as a standalone service that other applications can query:
```bash
# GET request
curl "https://ai.civic.com/bodyguard/check?prompt=Your%20prompt%20here"

# POST request
curl -X POST https://ai.civic.com/bodyguard/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Your prompt here"}'
```

### 2. Client Library
Integrate directly into your application:

```typescript
import { check } from '@civic/bodyguard';

const { result, threatScore, findings } = await check('User prompt here', {
  threshold: 0.5 // Fail if threat score > 0.5
});
```

### 3. CLI Tool

```bash
bodyguard "Analyze this prompt for threats"
```

### 4. MCP Hooks

Bodyguard can be used as a middleware for MCP servers, analyzing prompts before they reach the LLM:

```json
"mcpServers": {
    "passthrough-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx @civic/passthrough-mcp-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "TARGET_SERVER_URL": "https://your-mcp-server/mcp",
        "HOOKS": "https://ai.civic.com/bodyguard/hook?threshold=0.5"
      }
    }
  }
```

## Integration Notes

Bodyguard works as a complementary layer with other Civic Labs tools:

By implementing the **MCP Hooks** interface, Bodyguard can be used to wrap MCP server responses, providing protection against external inputs

Use with **Guardrail Proxy** for defense in depth, Bodyguard analyzes prompts while Guardrail enforces rules

Deploy before **MCP Hub** to pre-screen all requests to your MCP tools

Integrate with **Civic Knowledge** to protect internal systems and LLMs from potentially dangerous data sources

## Status

This flask is currently **distilling**:
Bodyguard is actively deployed in test environments and showing strong detection rates for common attack patterns.
We're expanding the threat detection capabilities and optimizing response times.
Docker images are available for easy deployment. [Contact us](/labs/feedback) if you'd like to test it with your specific use cases.
