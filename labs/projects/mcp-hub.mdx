## Overview

The MCP Hub is the core of Civic's Model Context Protocol platform.
It enables secure, on-demand execution of third-party MCP tools from an LLM or other agent.
By abstracting away container management, authorization workflows, and tool discovery,
it makes it simple to connect AI assistants to external tools while maintaining security and control.

The platform consists of three modular services: Directory (for MCP server discovery), Hub (for container orchestration), and AuthZ (for authorization and token management).

## Integration Patterns

The MCP Hub supports multiple integration approaches to fit your use case:

### Desktop AI Assistants
Connect Claude Desktop and other local AI agents to cloud-hosted MCP servers through our secure bridge. This enables:
- Access to enterprise tools from your desktop
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Automatic tool discovery and updates
- Cross-platform support

    />
</Frame>

### Backend Services & Applications
Build MCP capabilities directly into your applications:
- RESTful API for standard integrations
- SDK support for popular languages
- Compatible with AI frameworks like Vercel AI SDK
- Flexible authentication options

### Workflow Automation
Create no-code AI workflows with platforms like n8n:
- Visual workflow builders
- Pre-built templates and patterns
- Support for multiple AI models
- Easy tool orchestration

### Coming Soon
We're expanding support for additional platforms including Crew.ai, Make.com, and Zapier. [Join our waitlist](https://civickey.typeform.com/to/uVH7CWJ5) to be notified.

## Integration Notes

The MCP Hub works seamlessly with other Civic Labs tools:
- **Guardrail Proxy** can be deployed between the Hub and MCP servers for additional security
- **Bodyguard** can analyze prompts before they reach MCP tools
- **Pass-through Proxy** provides the middleware layer for adding custom logic

## Status

This flask is currently **distilling**: The core platform is functional with active development on additional features. The system is being used internally and with select partners. Contact us if you'd like to try it out or provide feedback.
