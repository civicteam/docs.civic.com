## Overview

The MCP Hub is the core of Civic's Model Context Protocol platform.
It enables secure, on-demand execution of third-party MCP tools from an LLM or other agent.
By abstracting away container management, authorization workflows, and tool discovery,
it makes it simple to connect AI assistants to external tools while maintaining security and control.

The platform consists of three modular services: Directory (for MCP server discovery), Hub (for container orchestration), and AuthZ (for authorization and token management).

## Getting Started

Choose your integration path:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I want to integrate with a local AI agent, such as Claude Desktop (Recommended)">
    Connect your desktop AI assistant to cloud-hosted MCP servers using our Hub Bridge.

      <Frame caption="Claude Desktop with Civic MCP Hub">
          <img
              src="/images/labs/projects/mcp-hub/claude-desktop.png"
              align="center"
              className="image-60 image-rounded"
          />
      </Frame>

    The Hub Bridge provides:
    - Seamless integration between desktop AI assistants and cloud MCP servers
    - Secure authentication flow
    - Automatic tool discovery
    - Support for multiple platforms (npm, homebrew, and more)
    
    [Contact us](/labs/feedback) for installation instructions and early access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to build into an agent or backend service">
      Civic's MCP Hub works as a standard MCP server, making it easy to integrate into any AI agent or backend service.

      Integration supports:
      - **[Civic Auth](https://civic.com/auth)**: Seamless authentication for your users
      - **[Vercel AI SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/ai)**: Quick integration with popular AI frameworks
      - **Direct API Integration**: For custom implementations
      - **Multiple Auth Methods**: Bearer tokens, API keys, and OAuth2
      
      The integration process involves:
      1. Setting up authentication (Civic Auth or API keys)
      2. Configuring your AI framework
      3. Connecting to the MCP Hub
      4. Accessing available tools
      
      [Contact us](/labs/feedback) for detailed integration guides and code examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I know what I'm doing, just give me the endpoint">
      [Contact us](/labs/feedback) for API endpoint access and documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to integrate with N8N">
      The MCP Hub integrates seamlessly with N8N to create no-code workflows powered by AI tools.

      <Frame caption="N8N Integration">
          <img
              src="/images/labs/projects/mcp-hub/n8n-import.png"

              className="image-60 image-rounded"
          />
      </Frame>

      Key features:
      - Pre-built workflow templates
      - Support for multiple AI models (AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic)
      - Visual workflow builder integration
      - API key authentication (OAuth2 coming soon)
      
      Getting started involves:
      1. Importing example workflows
      2. Configuring AI model credentials
      3. Setting up MCP Hub authentication
      4. Building your custom workflows
      
      [Contact us](/labs/feedback) for workflow templates and API access.

## Key Features

- **Container Orchestration**: Automatically manages Docker containers for MCP servers
- **OAuth Integration**: Built-in support for OAuth2 authorization flows
- **Tool Discovery**: Registry for finding and connecting to MCP servers
- **Token Management**: Secure handling of authentication tokens
- **Desktop Bridge**: Connect desktop LLM apps to cloud-hosted MCP servers
- **Guardrails**: Apply security policies to tool calls without modifying servers
- **Manage via LLM**: Full control over MCP servers and tools through LLM interactions
- **Full visibility and control**: List and revoke authorisations for you or your users

## Usage

The MCP Hub can be integrated in several ways:

1. **Direct API Integration**: Connect your application directly to the Hub API
2. **Desktop Bridge**: Use the hub-bridge package to connect desktop LLM apps
3. **CLI Testing**: Use the mcp-client CLI tool for development and testing
4. **Container Sidecar**: Deploy MCP servers with the stdio transport adapter
5. **Authorization Manager**: Use the MCP server for managing auth tokens

## Integration Notes

The MCP Hub works seamlessly with other Civic Labs tools:
- **Guardrail Proxy** can be deployed between the Hub and MCP servers for additional security
- **Bodyguard** can analyze prompts before they reach MCP tools
- **Pass-through Proxy** provides the middleware layer for adding custom logic

## Status

This flask is currently **distilling**: The core platform is functional with active development on additional features. The system is being used internally and with select partners. Contact us if you'd like to try it out or provide feedback.
