title: Flask Status
description: Understanding the maturity levels of Civic Labs experiments
public: true
---

Each project in Civic Labs is presented as a **flask**: an experiment in various stages of development.

## Flask Status Levels

### Bubbling 🫧

- These are concepts we're exploring internally.
- We're looking for collaborators, people and organizations that are interested in the topic and interested in working with us to bring the idea to fruition.

### Distilling 🧪  

- In active development - alpha versions exist.
- If you'd be interested in getting on the waitlist to try these out, [contact us!](/labs/feedback)

### Crystallizing 💎

- Functionally complete, available for testing in beta.
- Projects are generally available for anyone to try out, and we'd love for you to test them out and [let us know](/labs/feedback) what you think.

## ⚠️ Warning

All flasks are experiments. That means:
- Core functionality may change
- APIs may change
- They are not recommended for production without consultation
