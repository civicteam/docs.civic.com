## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Developed by Anthropic, MCP provides a universal way for AI models to interact with your systems while maintaining security and control.

## Why MCP Matters

Traditional AI assistants are limited to their training data and built-in capabilities. MCP changes this by allowing AI to:

- **Access Real-Time Data**: Connect to databases, APIs, and live systems
- **Use External Tools**: Execute code, manage files, or interact with third-party services
- **Maintain Context**: Share relevant information across conversations and sessions
- **Preserve Security**: Control exactly what the AI can access and do

## How It Works

MCP defines a standard protocol for communication between three components:

1. **MCP Client**: The AI assistant (like Claude) that wants to use tools
2. **MCP Server**: A service that provides specific tools or data access
3. **Transport Layer**: The communication method (HTTP, stdio, etc.)

```
AI Assistant (Client) ←→ MCP Protocol ←→ Your Tools (Server)
```

## Key Concepts

### Tools
Functions that the AI can call, like "search_database" or "send_email". Each tool has:
- A name and description
- Input parameters
- Expected output format

### Resources
Data sources the AI can read from, like files or API endpoints.

### Prompts
Pre-configured templates that help the AI use tools effectively.

## Security Model

MCP includes built-in security features:
- **Authentication**: Verify the AI's identity before granting access
- **Authorization**: Control which tools each AI can use
- **Audit Logging**: Track all AI-tool interactions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse or excessive usage

## In Civic Labs

We're extending MCP with additional security and management capabilities:
- **MCP Hub**: Centralized management and discovery of MCP servers
- **Guardrail Proxy**: Add security policies without modifying servers
- **Bodyguard**: Detect malicious prompts before they reach tools
- **Pass-through Proxy**: Insert custom logic into the MCP flow
