## Overview

Hooks provide a middleware layer for intercepting and processing MCP requests and responses. They enable you to add custom logic, security rules, or transformations without modifying the underlying MCP servers.

## How Hooks Work

```
AI Assistant → [Request Hook] → MCP Server
                                     ↓
AI Assistant ← [Response Hook] ← MCP Server
```

Each hook in the chain can:
- **Inspect** the request/response data
- **Modify** parameters or results
- **Block** requests based on custom rules
- **Enrich** data with additional context

## Common Hook Patterns

- **Security Filtering**: Validate requests against security policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Control request frequency and volume
- **Data Transformation**: Modify request/response formats
- **Audit Logging**: Record all tool interactions
- **Content Filtering**: Remove or redact sensitive information

## In Civic Labs

Hooks power several of our security tools:
- The [Pass-through Proxy](/labs/projects/passthrough-proxy) provides the core hook infrastructure
- The [Guardrail Proxy](/labs/projects/guardrail-proxy) implements security rules as hooks
- [Bodyguard](/labs/projects/bodyguard) can be deployed as a hook for threat detection
