## Overview

Authentication and authorization for AI systems presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional applications where a human user directly interacts with services, AI assistants act as intermediaries, requiring new approaches to maintain security while enabling useful functionality.

## The AI Auth Challenge

Traditional auth assumes:
- Direct user interaction with services
- Users understand what they're authorizing
- Sessions are short-lived and contextual

AI systems break these assumptions:
- The AI makes requests on behalf of users
- Users may not understand what the AI will do
- Sessions span multiple conversations and contexts
- The AI might combine multiple services unexpectedly

## Auth Strategies for AI

### 1. OAuth 2.0 with AI Extensions

Standard OAuth works but needs adaptations:
- **Scope Clarity**: Make scopes human-readable since users authorize AI access
- **Time Limits**: Add temporal bounds to permissions
- **Audit Trails**: Log what the AI actually did with the access

Example flow:
```
User → "AI, check my GitHub PRs"
AI → "I need GitHub access, please authorize: [OAuth Link]"
User → Authorizes specific repos
AI → Uses token to check PRs
```

### 2. Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)

RAR (RFC 9396) enables fine-grained, contextual permissions:

```json
{
  "type": "file_access",
  "locations": ["/project/docs"],
  "actions": ["read"],
  "purpose": "Summarize documentation",
  "max_duration": "1h"
}
```

Benefits:
- Context-aware permissions
- Purpose-bound access
- Granular control

### 3. Pre-Consent Patterns

Users pre-approve certain AI actions:
- **Template-Based**: "AI can always read my calendar for scheduling"
- **Conditional**: "AI can send emails if I explicitly say 'send'"
- **Bounded**: "AI can make API calls up to 100/day"

Implementation approaches:
- Store consent rules in user profiles
- Check consent before each action
- Provide clear consent management UI

### 4. Reusable Authentication

Minimize auth friction while maintaining security:

#### Token Vaulting
Store user tokens securely for reuse:
- Encrypt tokens at rest
- Implement token refresh logic
- Provide clear token inventory UI

#### Delegated Auth
The AI platform handles auth on behalf of users:
- Platform maintains service connections
- Users authorize the platform once
- Platform manages token lifecycle

#### Session-Based Auth
Maintain auth context within AI conversations:
- Auth persists for conversation duration
- Clear session boundaries
- Explicit session termination

## Security Considerations

### Token Leakage
- Never expose tokens in AI responses
- Implement token redaction in logs
- Use short-lived tokens when possible

### Scope Creep
- Regularly audit AI permission usage
- Implement least-privilege defaults
- Provide usage analytics to users

### Confused Deputy
- Validate the AI is acting for the right user
- Implement request signing/verification
- Maintain clear auth context

## Best Practices

1. **Transparency First**: Users should always know what the AI can access
2. **Explicit Consent**: Never assume permission for sensitive actions
3. **Granular Control**: Allow users to grant/revoke specific permissions
4. **Time Boundaries**: Implement automatic permission expiration
5. **Audit Everything**: Maintain detailed logs of AI actions

## In Civic Labs

Our MCP Hub implements several auth strategies:
- **OAuth Integration**: Built-in OAuth flow handling
- **Token Management**: Secure storage and refresh
- **Auth Context**: Maintains user context across MCP calls
- **Permission UI**: Clear visualization of granted permissions

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Just-In-Time Auth
```typescript
async function callTool(tool: string, params: any) {
  const token = await getTokenOrPromptAuth(tool);
  return await executeWithToken(tool, params, token);
}
```

### Pattern 2: Batch Pre-Auth
```typescript
// At conversation start
const requiredScopes = analyzeConversationNeeds();
const tokens = await requestBatchAuthorization(requiredScopes);
```

### Pattern 3: Progressive Auth
```typescript
// Start with read-only
let permissions = ['read'];

// Escalate as needed
if (userRequests.includes('modify')) {
  permissions = await requestAdditionalScopes(['write']);
}
```
