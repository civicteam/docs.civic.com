# Realms

[<mark style="color:orange;">Realms</mark>](https://realms.today) is the DAO governance platform on Solana, using the [<mark style="color:orange;">spl-governance</mark>](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance) program.

Civic Pass can be added to a DAO on Realms using the "[<mark style="color:orange;">plugin</mark>](https://github.com/solana-labs/governance-program-library)" system.

When using the Realms UI, no coding is required to integrate Civic Pass into your DAO. Simply follow the steps in the [<mark style="color:orange;">Realms docs page</mark>](https://docs.realms.today/Extra%20Guides/civic).

See section below for Civic Pass verifications available via the Realms UI. To add a pass not included in the UI dropdown, choose "Other" and enter the address manually.
