# Solana Token Extensions

[Solana Token Extensions](https://solana.com/solutions/token-extensions) is a feature-rich platform for building permissioned tokens on Solana. Token Extensions can be used with Civic Pass to provide a powerful, flexible, and simple mechanism for adding identity verification to a Token Extensions token using the [Civic Transfer Hook](https://github.com/civicteam/token-extensions-transfer-hook). Example use-cases are real-world assets and Sybil-resistance.

For details on setting up your token, see the details in the [transfer hook repository](https://github.com/civicteam/token-extensions-transfer-hook) or [contact us](mailto:bd@civic.com).
