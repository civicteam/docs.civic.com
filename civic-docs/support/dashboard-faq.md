# Dashboard FAQ

### How to access the Dashboard

Business and Enterprise clients will have access to a Dashboard where they can issue and manage their users’ Civic Passes. Within your organization, an authorized individual will need to send you an invitation via email to access the Dashboard.&#x20;



If you’ve already been invited to the Dashboard, follow the steps below:&#x20;

1. Go to dashboard.civic.com and click Login
2. Enter the name your organization uses to access the Dashboard and click Continue
3. Enter the email address invited to access the Dashboard and the email password. You can also ‘Continue with Google’ or ‘Continue with GitHub’.&#x20;



You will then be redirected to your organization’s Dashboard.&#x20;

### How to issue a Civic Pass to a user

Only Business and Enterprise clients can issue Civic Passes to their users in the Dashboard. Please keep in mind that Civic Passes can only be issued to one wallet address at a time.&#x20;



1. Log into the Dashboard at dashboard.civic.com and select Passes on the left side of the screen&#x20;
2. Enter the wallet address of the user to whom you wish to issue a Civic Pass
3. Select Issue Pass\


The Civic Pass will be issued to the user’s wallet after a few minutes but please keep in mind that this also depends on any congestion on the blockchain and any potential network issues.

### How to update a user's Civic Pass

Only Business and Enterprise clients can update and otherwise manage their users’ Civic Passes in the Dashboard. Civic Passes can be updated only one Civic Pass at a time. \


1. Log into the Dashboard at dashboard.civic.com and select Passes on the left side of the screen&#x20;
2. Enter the wallet address of the user whose Civic Pass you wish to update in the Search bar
3. The Civic Pass(es) associated with that user’s wallet address will be displayed on the screen. Select Update
4. A window will appear. Under Pass Status, select the drop-down menu and update the user’s Civic Pass status as desired&#x20;



Any changes made to a user’s Civic Pass will automatically update after a few minutes but please keep in mind that this also depends on any congestion on the blockchain and any potential network issues.&#x20;

### What do the various pass statuses mean?

The Active status means a user’s Civic Pass token is active and can be used to mint your project’s NFTs or connect to your dApp or DEX until the date and time of expiry. \


The Freeze status means a user’s Civic Pass has effectively been placed on hold, so the user can’t use the Civic Pass to mint your project’s NFTs or connect to your dApp or DEX. The Pass Status can still be updated to Active until the date and time their Civic Pass is set to expire. If you wish to update the expiration date of a frozen token, you’ll need to change the Pass Status to Active first.&#x20;



Updating a user’s Civic Pass status to Revoke is a permanent action that cannot be undone. It removes the Civic Pass from the user’s wallet. Furthermore, you won’t be able to issue a Civic Pass to that same wallet address on that specific chain network (e.g. Solana mainnet-beta, xdcApothem, etc) again. You will only be able to issue a new Civic Pass to a new wallet.&#x20;



The Expired status renders a Civic Pass inactive after a minute.&#x20;

### I issued or updated a user’s Civic Pass but there seems to be a delay in completing the action&#x20;

The time it takes for a Civic Pass to be issued or for any updates made to a user’s Civic Pass to take effect depends on the blockchain you’re using, the congestion on the blockchain, and any potential network issues. Depending on these conditions, there may be a time lag between when you make the update and when the change takes effect.&#x20;

### Is it possible to manage multiple passes at a time?&#x20;

The Dashboard allows Business and Enterprise clients to issue, revoke, activate, and expire Civic Passes one wallet address at a time.&#x20;
