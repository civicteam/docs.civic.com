# Quickstart

### Civic Pass

The easiest way to get up and running for free is with our **Civic Pass** integration. Civic will perform the verification, issuance and lifecycle management of the user's Civic Pass. For example, Civic can perform verifications of identity documents, location and humanness on your behalf. The cost of the pass will be paid for by the user.
