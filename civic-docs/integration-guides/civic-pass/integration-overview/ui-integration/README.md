# UI Integration

Civic provides two React libraries to manage the issuance and status of your users' Civic Passes directly from your front-end.

* The first one is a [<mark style="color:orange;">UI modal</mark> ](ui-modal/)that overlays your existing UI, keeping your users within your experience.  This modal will walk the user through the verification process.
* The second one is an Identity Button to display user's [<mark style="color:orange;">Pass Status</mark>](pass-status-ui.md), ie. active, expired, revoked, and then trigger the verification process through the UI modal.
